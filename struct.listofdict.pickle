aVThese babies are the perfect little pre dinner appetizers. They are super pretty, especially if you nail the twist pre bake. I prefer to serve these in a glass, or a something like a weck jar to show off their long slender shape. You could totally pair these with a myriad of dipping sauces if you wanted, but they are also just perfect by themselves. They also keep really well, and in my opinion would make a great vehicle to consume things like mashed potatoes. They are really an elegant and delicious addition to any kind of meal. Get your straw on!

VWhile the work piles up, and time off is non-existent, staying sane for me happens with the little things. Here are some of my little things:
p141
aV1. Do something that makes you feel pretty. Pluck those eyebrows or braid your hair, or wear some neat jewelry.
p142
aV2. If you have a spare moment, Google pictures of somewhere you want to go. My latest go to Google image search is camping in a tee pee.
p143
aV3. Look at A Cozy Kitchen\u2019s Cute Animal pinterest board: 
p144
aV4. Draw doodles. My favorite doodle is looking at someone, drawing his or her face without looking at the paper or lifting up the pen.
p145
aV5. Think about how much cooler life is going to be once Downton Abbey returns.
p146
aV6. Take baths. They are awesome and relaxing and I don\u2019t think most people do it enough.
p147
aVOk you guys. We have some crazy delicious Banana Bread for you today. Do you see its one recipe three ways? Throughout the week we will be posting two more recipes that utilize banana bread in other crazy amazing combinations. So keep a look out. We hope you love them!

aVWe\u2019re ending our week of pizza dough with a dessert\u2026..cinnamon-sugar messy bread with vanilla icing! It\u2019s super easy to make and fun to eat. I made mini loaves because I thought they were cute, but you can also make one large loaf (baked for a longer amount of time).  This is a fun way to turn a savory pizza dough recipe into a sweet treat. I think everyone should bake a prosciutto, butternut squash and kale pizza this weekend, serve it with parmesan-garlic straws and finally finish the meal off with everyones own individual cinnamon-sugar messy bread. It\u2019s a great way to use a basic pizza dough, three different ways. Enjoy! xx Jenny

aVHey Guys! I hope you\u2019ve all enjoyed our week of banana bread! We\u2019re wrapping things up with banana bread churro bites\u2026.yep! We\u2019re serving our bites with a dipping sauce that\u2019s basically melty ice cream and espresso\u2026so good! I can\u2019t take credit for this crazy and totally decadent dessert. I had something very similar at A-Frame in Culver City! A-Frame is one of the few restaurants owned by bad-ass chef Roy Choi (swoooon! I have a thing for chefs, tis\u2019 true). The cocktails at A-Frame are out of this world and the food\u2026.whoa. Their Air-Dried Hoisin Ribs? Okay! Beer Can Chicken? YUM! Swordfish Tacos with pickled this and awesome that? YesYesYes! Finally, there\u2019s the churro style banana bread sticks with some sort of melty ice cream sauce! While I\u2019m sure his sauce is more complex then some ice cream and coffee, I think I did pretty well with the churro banana bread! Turning them into bites just make it easier to pop into your mouth and the whole melty sauce thing? Sort of feels like you\u2019re dipping cookies in milk x100\u2026pretty awesome. ;)
p275
aVIf you\u2019re a little squeamish about deep frying your banana bread,  I would toast them in the oven at 350 degrees F for about 20-25 minutes, before spraying them with a light coating of cooking spray and tossing them in the cinnamon-sugar mix. The cinnamon sugar may not stick quite as well, but they\u2019re still really good nonetheless! Hope you all make these this weekend! Enjoy!

V\u000aDid anyone else in LA feel that earthquake early this morning? I thought it was my cats fighting on the bed at first. I have not felt an earthquake here in years, and I\u2019m surprised it woke me up. When I woke up this morning I went and read the news to see if I could find any information on the quake. It was pretty close to where I live. The thing about the article that freaked me out the most was this weird foreshadowing paragraph at the end that stated that in the past 10 days, there have been earthquakes around Los Angeles. Ok, what is that supposed to mean? A huge one is coming? Are you trying to freak everyone out? I\u2019m freaked out. I think it may be time to get some earthquake insurance for all the props in the studio. Speaking of props and the studio, Jenny and I are in the new issue of

aVIt was 90 degrees yesterday. I am convinced that not having air conditioning is a survival of the fittest situation, and if you do not have one, you die. Mix 90 degree weather with a leather couch, and a hot computer on your lap and you have a mess. My gross legs stuck to my couch to the point where I knew getting up would be painful. Also, I think I have done permanent skin damage to the part of my legs where my laptop sits. I do not think they will ever look the same. EVER. Other than that, this weekend was fun. I spent time thinking how my favorite

It should stop immediately.) I could be mistaken, it was dark. I also found out how much prosecco is too much. Overall a great weekend. How was yours?
p463
aVNow, on to food. Artichokes are one of my favorites. They are soooo pretty. Like a nice mid century design, and a great color. We have three artichoke recipes this week. All of which are super gorgeous. This Artichoke Sun-Dried Tomato & Goat Cheese Pasta recipe is great because its a lighter pasta dish.

aVRisotto is one of my favorite foods. EVER. I love it so much because it\u2019s so easy to make and you can add all kinds of things to it. Getting into the spirit of fall, while trying to ignore this totally non-fall weather we\u2019ve been experiencing in L.A. (BOO!) lately, I decided to make some pumpkin risotto. I love pumpkin almost as much as I love risotto\u2026.almost. To me pumpkin is something that\u2019s completely underrated. Sure, there\u2019s pumpkin spice lattes (totally yum) and pumpkin pie (again, yum), but there\u2019s so much you can do with pumpkin that I want to see done more often, like maybe pumpkin ale beer brats?\u2026roasted pumpkin hummus?\u2026.or even baked pumpkin chips?! Today we\u2019re sticking with pumpkin risotto and topping it off with seared scallops(light and sweet to compliment the pumpkin flavor) and a confetti of candied pancetta (because confetti is fun and candied pancetta is awesome). You can save time on this already simple dish by making the pumpkin puree mixture a day or two a head of time. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious you can go ahead and roast your own pumpkin instead of using canned, but I think canned pumpkin puree works just fine, plus it saves mucho time. Okay, enjoy! xx Jenny

aVI had this drink for the first time 7 years ago in Salvador, Brazil. A capiroska is pretty much caipirinha\u2019s less popular little sister. They\u2019re practically the same drink except a caipirinha is made with cachaca and a capiroska is made with vodka. Now normally even the idea of vodka would make me want to vom (just not a fan), but you can make this drink quite strong without the usual \u201crubbing alcohol\u201d throat burn. When I ordered the drink I had no idea what I was ordering since the entire menu was in Portuguese, a language I sadly do not speak except for the word \u201ckiwi\u201d. I thought to myself, \u201cEh, I like kiwi\u2019s, why not.\u201d Little did I know I was about to discover my drink of choice for the remainder of my month stay in Brazil. I was a little bummed when my drink didn\u2019t come in a big, shiny coconut like every other persons drink at my table\u2026.just a tall, clear glass filled with clear liquid and muddled kiwis. I took one sip and my coconut envy disappeared immediately! Not only could I not taste the abrasive flavor of vodka (sorry vodka fans!), but it was also only subtly sweet and not overly syrupy. I was pretty much in heaven! Not to mention I was munching on spicy shrimp filled acaraje (black-eyed pea fritters), and surrounded by a diverse group of fascinating people, so I really couldn\u2019t be happier! I\u2019ve since made my own version a number of times, altering amounts of this and that along the way, and this recipe is the closest I could get to bring me back to my amazing stay in the beautiful and culturally thriving country of Brazil. This drink is so wonderful year round, light and refreshing! Enjoy!

VI turned 30 last Friday. What a weird experience that was. I don\u2019t really do much for my birthdays because honestly, they are not that big of deal to me. This one for some reason was different. When you\u2019re little, or a teen in junior high you have all these high hopes for where you will be when you\u2019re 30, successful, with a huge house, cool friends, exercising, and generally being weird. When you get to 30 and some of those dreams are not real yet it\u2019s a strange feeling. It\u2019s not like I have accomplished nothing, or that I feel like I have let myself down in anyway, it\u2019s more like \u201cWow, life moves fast, and it\u2019s kinda scary.\u201d In the week leading up to my 30th I had lots of mini melt down, and a couple of bigger ones. Most involved crying, and some involved sobbing for no reason. I was totally weirdly emotional. Yuck. Luckily, all my friends who are in their 30\u2019s were telling me how much better the 30\u2019s are than your 20\u2019s. So I do feel a lot better. I also feel a renewed sense of ambition to do things, lots of things, different things. Kind of exciting! I wonder how you all felt when you turned 30?
p878
aVSome of you probably have seen from our Instagram that one of us is in Tokyo. That\u2019s me! I\u2019m there! Eating sushi and ramen and gaining a million pounds. This is my birthday trip! Follow along! \u263a
p879
aVTo cheers to my 30th can we all just please eat some meatballs? Meatballs are one of my favorite food groups. You can eat them as an appetizer, put them on a pasta, or put them in a huge sandwich, which is my preferred way of consumption. These meatballs are a little spicy and a lot delicious. Another way I will totally eat these are cold, like left over pizza the next day, still delicious. Is that gross? I hope not. Enjoy!

It has a slightly smoky and black pepper finish to it that pleasantly lingers in the mouth. It\u2019s a wonderful wine to use for cooking as well and I love it in our marinara sauce. It adds an element of depth to the deliciously simple sauce.
p954
aVWe also use marjoram in our sauce, instead of the typical oregano. I love the scent and flavor of marjoram and I like to call it the cousin of oregano. It has a mild, sweet pine and citrus flavor, that doesn\u2019t overpower the tomatoes. This marinara sauce is so simple to make and you can seriously pour this stuff on anything! I love using it in my lasagnas, as a base for a complex red sauce and even as a dipping sauce for garlic bread, fried ravioli and more! Stay tuned to see what we decide to do with this yummy marinara sauce, this Friday! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VContinuing with our Traditional Thanksgiving Spread week, today we have an easy green bean side dish. These Lightly Roasted Green Beans are a really simple recipe which we love because we all know how complicated making Thanksgiving can be. As a kid, I never did eat very many vegetables (I was a total brat). I did however always love those green bean casseroles with the mushroom stuff and the onions on top. As I grew up though, I kind of lost my taste for the mushy green beans (I\u2019ll still eat em though!) in favor of cooked but still snappy green beans. So this recipe is perfect for that. Lightly roasted, and then topped with a parmesan almond crumble. Yum. I love the crunch that the almond gives this dish.  Stayed tuned because we have another side dish coming up this week that I am in love with!

V\u000aHi Guys! We hope you guys are enjoying our very first spread! We\u2019re both so excited about the new series and hope this spread is helpful for those of you in need of ideas for Thanksgiving or just in general!
p1304
aVToday we have our first new recipe, which happens to be a Citrus and Herb Roasted Turkey! This brine recipe is pretty simple, but I really love it. It makes your turkey extra juicy and the aromatics (orange peel and herbs) leave a super light, subtle flavor. I love this because it really allows for the flavor of the turkey itself to stand out. If you want a more \u201cherbacious\u201d and citrus tasting bird, feel free to add more citrus peels and herbs to your brine.
p1305
aVI\u2019ve also begun to not truss my turkeys as I feel it just creates more work and the results are pretty much the same. The only thing I do is fold the wing tips back so they don\u2019t burn. If you prefer the legs tied, by all means tie them up! No bigs.
p1306
aVOh and something I should mention is that everything in this weeks spread is cooked for real and is the actual recipe\u2026except this turkey. I faked this turkey, food stylist-style. I thought I should mention that incase people expect a perfectly browned bird. The brine is great and I stand by this recipe (I\u2019ve made it the last two years!), but the actual results will give you a pretty unevenly browned bird (especially because of the high temp you start with when you begin roasting the bird)\u2026still super delicious. I was just coming off of styling a bunch of turkeys for these target holiday commercials (which are just beginning to air on tv now, yay!)when we shot this spread and I couldn\u2019t resist faking just one more turkey. :)  Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V1. The night before thanksgiving, brine your turkey (for 8 to 12 hours).
p1356
aV2. For brine: Pour salt, sugar, peppercorns, coriander seeds, cloves, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, orange peels, apple cider, and vegetable stock into a large pot and simmer until salt and sugar dissolve, about 15 minutes. Allow mixture to sit until completely cooled. Stir mixture into ice water. If using brining bag, place turkey into bag and pour brine over turkey. Seal and place in refrigerator overnight. If using bucket, place turkey into bucket, breast side down, and pour brine over the bird. Place in refrigerator or a cold, dry place (if it doesn\u2019t fit in the refrigerator) overnight (adding 2 to 3 cups of ice to the mixture every 4 hours if turkey sits out overnight). Remove turkey from brine, pat dry and place onto the rack of a roasting pan. Discard brine.
p1357
aV3. Preheat oven to 450\u02daF.
p1358
aV4. Stuff cavity with stuffing or aromatics of choice (such as an apples, citrus, onions, herbs, cinnamon stick, etc).
p1359
aV5. Roast turkey for 30 minutes. Lower temperature to 350\u02daF and continue to roast for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until the thermometer reads 161\u02daF in the thickest part of the turkey\u2019s leg.

VHi Guys! Today we are thrilled to introduce the first \u201cspread\u201d in Spoon Fork Bacon\u2019s \u201cspreads\u201d series! In this series, Teri and I will be presenting a variety of \u201cspreads\u201d (in this case a 
p1392
aV with a mix of some archived recipes and a handful of brand new recipes. Each spread we present will begin the week  with showcasing the entire spread itself, with links provided to our archived recipes. We will then spend the rest of the week presenting our new blog recipes within the spread. We\u2019re both so excited to finally get started with this series and hope to help and inspire you all in the kitchen for your next get together or party!
p1393
aVOur first spread is our traditional thanksgiving spread! We thought it would be fun to tackle a holiday that is incredibly food focused but can also be pretty intimidating to so many home cooks! We pulled some of our favorite thanksgiving recipes and included them into our thanksgiving feast!
p1394
aV- 
p1395
aV This recipe comes from Teri\u2019s family and is super special because of the addition of whipped cottage cheese! The whipped cottage cheese makes the potatoes so light, fluffy and totally addicting\u2026.and the completely necessary pools of melted butter on top don\u2019t hurt either!
p1396
aV- 
p1397
aV We love these savory and delicious biscuits! They\u2019re super easy to throw together and hello mini leftover thanksgiving sandwich slider buns!
p1398
aV- 
p1399
aV Ever since this stuffing was \u2018birthed\u2019 a couple years ago, it\u2019s been my favorite stuffing EVER. I make it every year and am pretty sure it\u2019ll be nestled on my thanksgiving table for years and years to come. The savory sausage, with the fragrant sage, tangy and chewy cranberries, and crunchy hazelnuts\u2026it\u2019s a total flavor and texture party in your mouth!
p1400
aV- 
p1401
aV Neither of us really developed an appreciation for a good cranberry sauce until we hit adulthood and realized that sweet and savory anything together was an incredible combo! Now we totally get that no traditional thanksgiving table is complete without a simple, yet deliciously tangy cranberry sauce!
p1402
aV- 
p1403
aV We both get so excited for winter squash season and love incorporating them into our meals. This simple, yet elegant dish is filled with a perfect blend of maple sweetness with savory seasonal flavors. A perfect addition to any thanksgiving table and another great meatless alternative to our vegetarian friends and family!
p1404
aV- 
p1405
aV Hot apple cider is one of those cozy weather drinks that we absolutely love to indulge in during the holidays! Our version is simple and delicious and pretty versatile. It can be made into a non-alcoholic treat by simply leaving out the booze, as well as served as a chilled beverage for anyone who prefers a chilly cocktail!
p1406
aV- 
p1407
aV We recently posted our very best pumpkin pie and we\u2019re excited to have it in our spread\u2026.such a classic thanksgiving dessert! One little twist is that we used the ginger snap crust and meringue topping from our 
p1408
aV, which is another great pie option for your thanksgiving table!
p1409
aVWe hope you guys like our first spread, our Traditional Thanksgiving Spread! We\u2019re so excited for the rest of the week as we get into our new recipes. We\u2019re also so excited to get more into this series and create more fun and awesome spreads for you guys in the near future! Enjoy! xx, Jenny + Teri

VHi Guys! Today we have another spread for you all! We have a \u201cnot so traditional thanksgiving spread\u201d. We both love thanksgiving dishes, but know that not everyone does, so today we\u2019ve prepared an autumnal spread for the non-turkey loving, \u201cChandler Bing-ish\u201d folks out there! Lets get started!
p1489
aV- 
p1490
aV We love the sweet caramel and salty, cheesy combination of this fun and slightly unique treat! It\u2019s the perfect snack to have of the table before the main event\u2026just make sure everyone doesn\u2019t fill up on this as it really can be that addicting!
p1491
aV- 
p1492
aV These little guys are actually our buttermilk cornbread recipe, redressed into little loaves and topped with sprigs of fresh oregano for added fragrance, flavor and most importantly, cuteness. If you don\u2019t have an individual loaf pan, no worries! Just bake the recipe in an 8\u201dx 8\u201d baking dish, as directed by the original recipe, and top the whole dish with sprigs of oregano (or herb of your choice, except rosemary as the stem is a little too thick for this) and cut into individually topped pieces after the cornbread has baked and cooled.
p1493
aV 
p1494
aV- 
p1495
aV If you\u2019re looking for a different and low maintenance cocktail on this busy holiday, this is the perfect drink for you! All you really need is Coca-Cola (we\u2019re assuming all thanksgiving tables will already by flooded with loads of wine and champagne) and you have a surprisingly tasty cocktail!
p1496
ag1494
aV- 
p1497
aV We absolutely love sweet potatoes and can totally devour these twice-baked sweet potatoes every time they\u2019re made. We love the crispy crust the twice baking creates, but hands down our favorite part are the feta and toasted pecan topping. If you want to add a hint of sweetness to this side dish, a light drizzle of honey or maple syrup should do the trick!
p1498
aV- 
p1499
aV Move over green beans, these balsamic grilled carrots are taking over this thanksgiving spread! The rich and tangy balsamic-butter sauce, make this side dish absolutely addicting. Don\u2019t have a grill or you think it\u2019s too cold to grill? No problem! Just toss the carrots in the marinade and roast in the oven at 375\u02daF for 325 to 30 minutes or until fork tender with a crisp exterior. Yum!
p1500
aV- 
p1501
aV Thanksgiving desserts don\u2019t always have to be all about pumpkin or pecan pie. If you\u2019re getting a little sick of seasonal pies we think this spicy chocolate stout cake is the best thanksgiving pie substitute. This quick and easy cake and buttercream duo can be made a day or two ahead of time and finished the day of the event by rewhipping the buttercream, spreading it over the sheet cake and serving it up. Super easy, totally delicious!
p1502
aVWe hope we have been able to inspire you all to get into the kitchen and get creative with your thanksgiving spread this year! Don\u2019t forget to stay tuned the rest of the week as we introduce our new recipes including our: Maple Glazed Roast Duck, Apple-Thyme and Wild Rice Stuffing, Shave Brussels Sprouts Salad with a Prosciutto-Mustard Vinaigrette, and finally our no bake pumpkin creme brulee!

VHi Guys! Today we have our first new recipe in our \u201cNot So Traditional Thanksgiving Spread\u201d and we\u2019re replacing the typical thanksgiving centerpiece with a gorgeous Maple-Balsamic Roasted Duck and serving it with a simple, spiced cranberry and persimmon chutney.
p1587
aVI\u2019m not going to lie, every year when thanksgiving dinner rolls around, I find myself with a plate loaded up with sides and a tiny sliver of turkey hanging off the corner. It\u2019s true. I like a nice juicy turkey, but with so many amazing side dishes being passed around the table, it\u2019s hard not to forget about the roasted turkey sometimes. Also, while I like turkey, I don\u2019t love it. I also think that it\u2019s difficult for a lot of people who aren\u2019t celebrating with dozens of people to rationalize preparing an entire turkey. I totally understand and that\u2019s why I think this roasted duck is the perfect thanksgiving turkey substitute. Think one duck won\u2019t be enough? No problem, just roast two of them! The cooking time will still be much less than if you were roasting an entire turkey.
p1588
aVYou\u2019ll end up with a juicy duck with a sweet, tangy and crispy skin. It\u2019s important to allow your duck to sit uncovered in the refrigerator overnight if you want the fat to render and the skin to crisp up. It\u2019s also important to remember that because so much fat will render from the skin, you want to make sure the layer of aromatics is thick enough to work as an organic \u201cwire\u201d rack so that the back side of the duck doesn\u2019t end up frying in its own fat.
p1589
aVWe hope you guys will stick around the rest of the week as we get through the rest of our new recipes in our \u201cnot so traditional thanksgiving spread\u201d! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVAlright, so this is a Carrie Bradshaw recipe. I\u2019ve finally been watching Sex and the City. I\u2019m a little late, I know, but I really like the show. That is until Carrie becomes a spoiled brat and ruins everything she has with Aiden. She is such a 5 year old. It makes me mad. You and me both know she never ever cooks! She doesn\u2019t want to get food on her ugly designer shoes! So this is what I call a Carrie Bradshaw recipe because its so easy, even a dingus like Carrie can make it. I sincerely hope that after finishing ALL of Sex and the City, and then watching the movies, that my respect for Carrie will begin to flourish as opposed to dwindle. Please tell me I am right.

p1704
aV. When we walked to our table we passed their dessert case there were a million desserts in their looking pretty begging me to eat them. We ate one, their seasonal dessert of Pumpkin Crème Brulee. Their Crème Brulee was made in little hollowed out mini pumpkins, and prepared so you could eat some pumpkin chunks while you eat your delicious custard. I was sold. I knew them we HAD to attempt to re make this for the blog. Welcome our version: No Bake Pumpkin Crème Brulee. How freaking cute are these little individual desserts? I was so pumped to have this be included in our Not So Traditional Thanksgiving spread, because these little guys are so cute and so unique. I am in love with them. Not only is crème brulee one of my all time favorite desserts, but so is pumpkin pie. So I am pretty excited about this, to say the least. As Thanksgiving draws closer, think about making these guys! NO BAKE! WHOA! We know you\u2019re short on oven space, so these just make such perfect sense. I hope you are as stoked as me.

VHi Guys! Okay, so I have sort of a random question for you and I\u2019m really hoping someone out there has an answer for me\u2026if you are a glasses wearer, how do you alleviate the fogging issue??? I\u2019m serious. I finally got glasses last week, after realizing driving at night was beginning to get a little dangerous. So now I wear these things on my face, most of the time, and the fog issue is out of control!! If you know me personally, you know that I\u2019m always hot or get hot very easily. I can be sitting in a room, doing absolutely nothing and I can feel my cheeks getting warm. Why? I have no idea! This was never a real problem until glasses happened to me. Now the second my cheeks get warm, major fog-age! Terrible! I know this is super nerdy, but I would really love any tips or advice anyone might have. I\u2019ve read things online about rubbing Vaseline onto your lenses, but that just seems weird and gross to me\u2026plus I\u2019m worried about ruining the \u2018fancy\u2019 coating that are apparently on my lenses. So if anyone could help me out with this lil\u2019 problem I would love you forever and ever and ever!
p1773
aVAnyway, moving past my personal issues and onto today\u2019s recipe. We have a Sweet Potato and Rosemary Gratin! This gratin is easy, very easy. I used buttermilk instead of the usual milk or cream because I like the slight tang it adds to this dish. Just one little thing\u2026 please don\u2019t skip out on the broiling part at the end! The crispy crust that\u2019s created, up against the soft, savory interior? HEAVEN! And because sweet potatoes and rosemary were pretty much made for one another I threw a little of that in there as well. If you\u2019re looking to spice up your thanksgiving table, this quick and easy sweet potato and rosemary gratin might be worth trying out! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

If you\u2019re cooking Thanksgiving this year, I urge you to try this recipe, if you\u2019re not, then think about this dish for the near future! It is such a delicious winter dish! I will sadly not be eating Thanksgiving this year because I will be soaking up the sun in Hawaii eating seafood. I will however probably be making a mini feast when I return mostly so I can make

p1879
aV about a month ago? Well I still have a ton of it. I love making jam and eating it, but I always find that I always make more than I know what to do with. These super \u201csemi-homemadeish\u201d pastries are a great way to use up all the homemade jam you might have laying around from the summer. So we have made Blackberry Jam Straws & Blackberry Stuffed Cinnamon Rolls. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious you can make your own cinnamon rolls from scratch. I wasn\u2019t feeling so ambitious so I bought some; I\u2019m usually not a fan of the canned cinnamon roll dough, but I kind of like them with sweet berry jam swirled in them. I\u2019m not going to lie, the cinnamon rolls can get a bit messy when unrolling, stuffing, and re-rolling, but it\u2019s so easy it\u2019s worth it. You can totally skip the homemade icing and use the stuff that comes with the cans, but I just prefer to make my own because it takes two minutes and tastes much better, me thinks. Enjoy and have a great weekend!

aV\u000aHi Guys! So the most exciting thing is happening! I\u2019m moving!!! Okay, so I\u2019m staying in the city of Redondo Beach, but this time I\u2019m moving beachside! That\u2019s right, the boyfriend, Dexter and I are all moving next to the water and we\u2019re thrilled!
p1934
aVWhile the boyfriend is excited to be in a 1 minute walking range from his favorite watering hole, Naja\u2019s place, and one of our favorite burger joints, the Standing Room, I\u2019m most excited to be in walking distance to the fresh seafood market at the pier, a whole foods market and my favorite local farmer\u2019s market! I can\u2019t wait to not have to hop in my car to run a few errands! I know this might seem like a small feat, but I look at being able to walk outside and arrive at your destination on foot (in a reasonable amount of time) a luxury\u2026especially living in LA!
p1935
aVAnyway, with this crazy move happening during the holidays (terrible timing!) I feel like I barely have time to cook a proper meal. Something I\u2019ve been making big batches of lately, to help save myself on time, is this Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad. I\u2019ll make a batch of it on Monday and eat it multiple times a day through at least Wednesday. If I start to get bored with it I toss in some pepitas, pomegranate seeds or dried cranberries (dried and chopped cantaloupes are pretty amazing in this too!). I\u2019ll also add some quick sauteed garlic shrimp or chicken if I want to bulk it up. It\u2019s such a great go to salad/meal when you\u2019re limited on time. I love it because the brussels sprouts are so hearty that even after it\u2019s tossed together with the vinaigrette, it takes DAYS for the veg to become soggy and I actually like it when the brussels sprouts have been sitting in the vinaigrette for a day or so, the flavors really have a chance to develop. The pretzel croutons also don\u2019t get too soggy like you might expect them to; they definitely soften as time goes on but I kind of like that. If you\u2019re not into \u201csoft\u201d pretzel bits in your salad, you can always make extra pretzel croutons and refresh your salad with nice, crisp croutons every time you take this salad to the face!
p1936
aVBrussels sprouts and bacon are such a perfect combination of flavors that a prosciutto vinaigrette just makes sense. The whole grain mustard adds a simple, but great tangy flavor and cuts through the richness of the butter and prosciutto, balancing the dish out nicely. This Thanksgiving we thought it would be nice to include brussels sprouts because it just screams chilly seasonal eats; but we thought we\u2019d skip out on the typical roasting and make a deliciously, hearty salad that is good enough to stand up next to all the other thanksgiving side dish contenders. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVCan I tell you guys a little secret? I have a weird obsession with scones. I mean, I like eating them, but I LOVE making them! There is so much you can do with a scone. You can make them savory or sweet, enjoy them with a hot coffee or tea, slather them with homemade curd or jam or a delicious herb butter and so on and so on.They\u2019re also SO easy to make, it\u2019s seriously about 10-15 minutes of prep and about 25 minutes of baking. Easy-Peesy. I developed this particular scone recipe a few months ago because I needed to make a small something to bring to a brunch I was attending the next day.I took my basic sweet scone recipe, scaled down the sugar and and added a few of my favorite savory ingredients that I ALWAYS have on hand; bacon (duh), Gruyere (my favorite hard cheese) and green onions (it\u2019s kind of a Korean thing). All I can say is that 20 minutes after I arrived to the brunch my scones were gone and 4 people were asking me for a recipe. I just don\u2019t see how one can go wrong with salty, buttery, cheesy goodness?! I will definitely be making this for many more brunches to come and then some :)

So think about those last minute holiday gifts. In other news, I bought my cat a bow tie I am really excited about. I am also in the market for new photo props, so if any of you know awesome places to buy plates and things please tell me! I would very much appreciate it.

aVI pretty much hate eating salads. I never crave them. I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend to be some healthy person who eats salads all the time because I \u201clike\u201d them, or eat sliced tomatoes or celery as a snack. Get real. I do understand that my diet can\u2019t just consist of meat and bread and pork and potatoes and goldfish crackers. I do I get it. But salads, unless they have bacon and a butt load of bleu cheese, I\u2019m just not that into it. This salad is different. It actually tastes good. Other salads, while granted are leafy greens ones, kinda taste like I\u2019m eating grass from my front lawn where the feral cats hang out. This salad is rad because it has so much texture and crunch. So if you\u2019re a salad hater like me, you should try this. I feel like its a good jumping off point to eating salads for every meal like all the girls here in LA do.

aVHi Everyone! I hope you all had a great holiday weekend and that travelling wasn\u2019t too hectic for anyone. I just flew back from Chicago, after spending a whole week at home with my family and I\u2019m still craving my mom\u2019s home cooking. Whenever I\u2019m in the mood for a little taste of home, I tend to make this simple dish. My mom normally makes this dish with leftover kimchi and pork belly stew, but I\u2019ve made mine vegetarian (with the exception of the egg) this time around and with regular kimchi from the fridge. If you want this dish to be more hearty, by all means add some thinly sliced pork belly, it\u2019s really good! The kimchi adds a nice unique and spicy flavor to the fried rice and its something that can be eaten by itself and still be nice and filling. This dish is also super simple to make and if you\u2019re someone who regularly has kimchi in your fridge, you most likely already have the other ingredients lying around as well. If you don\u2019t have kimchi (with 7 boxes of baking soda surrounding it) in your fridge everyday like me, then the nearest Korean market is your best bet to find the stuff and for the best quality. If kimchi is something you\u2019re never tried then I urge you to go out and give this amazing Korean super food, filled with antioxidants, a shot! Enjoy!

aVHi all! Today we have a really fresh and simple Kale Salad with blood oranges. I love to cook; that\u2019s really no secret, but sometimes I come home exhausted from work and I don\u2019t want to cook, nor do I feel like going out. The results? I usually end up noshing on cheese and crackers or break romaine leaves apart and dip them in dressing. Sad, I know.
p2277
aVEven more depressing, lately I\u2019ve been trying to be \u201chealthy\u201d and well, it sucks. The other day I broke out my new (as of Christmas) Vitamix and tried my hand at home juicing. The juice was actually pretty awesome and I didn\u2019t mind the slightly pulpy texture due to no pulp extractor like in an actual juicer. I took more time to prep and clean then I had hoped which sucked, especially since it was a super busy day for me.
p2278
aVI\u2019ve been eating a lot of wheatberry, kale and quinoa just trying to mix things up all the time and keep me from getting bored. This Blood Orange & Kale Salad is actually one that\u2019s been on my regular rotation of \u201chealthy meals\u201d and it\u2019s one of my faves! It\u2019s super easy to put together (I\u2019ll usually make this salad and vinaigrette in the morning before work, in two separate containers, so when I come home it\u2019s just pour, cover and shake. It\u2019s so filling and flavorful that I actually don\u2019t crave hot dogs and doughnuts 20 minutes after I\u2019m finishing eating, like most salad make me feel. This salad is seriously awesome anytime. Go try it! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VHi Hi Hi! Yay! Our first ever crafty how to whatever you want to call it. I\u2019m really excited for it! Watercolor Easter Eggs. Pretty right?!?! AND really really easy. I will show you. Here we go. This is what you need:
p2391
aV 
p2392
aVDye + plastic spoons. I used this 
p2393
aV, but I\u2019m sure food coloring would work just fine.  You need vinegar, and water to prep your eggs, and a baking sheet, or metal tin to collect the run off dye. The secret to these is to make a dark color version of dye, and then a lighter. I just added 50% more water to the existing color to make a lighter version.
p2394
aVFirst prep your eggs. Get a bowl, mix 50% water and 50% vinegar and wipe the eggs down with the mixture. Dry em. Then grab you spill collector. Start with the lighter colors. Its all about layering dark to light. Hold the egg over the tin on both ends, and simply pour some color over it. After you have made your pour, turn the egg in your hand so the color goes all the way around. You MUST let the color completely dry in between the pours. I used a blow dryer to speed things up. Once your egg is dry, repeat with another light color, or a darker one. This part is where you can get crazy. You can do a lot of pours, or a little.
p2395
aV*See that little white plastic circle in #2? Thats a water bottle cap. It makes a great holder to dry your egg on.
p2396
aV** I didn\u2019t wear latex gloves in the picture, but you probably should. :)
p2397
aVBOOM. Super pretty, really easy, Watercolor Easter Eggs. Yay.I Really hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I did, and I hope you all find time this weekend to crank out some awesome Easter eggs!
p2398
aVTo compliment our Easter eggs, we wanted to do a prettier version of an egg salad sandwich. Lets be real, egg salad isn\u2019t the prettiest thing ever. So we decided to deconstruct it a bit. The result is a super pretty, super simple sandwich. Aren\u2019t the eggs so pretty and graphic?!? This seems like the perfect post Easter egg hunt lunch to me!

aVCan we just talk for a second about how much I am looking forward to the Hunger Games movie? I feel embarrassed by it. Like admitting I am totally obsessed with Twilight (I\u2019m not. Ok I am kinda am, ugh). WHY do I like all these movies? Is it a series thing? Star wars, Love. Harry Potter, I watch parts of movies at least once a week. Twilight, less so, I went through a phase with that. Why do I feel like people judge me because I love all that crap? Are you secretly judging me? Its ok if you are. I will try not to judge you for judging me. :) Do you ever wish there was like an Eternal Sunshine erase your memory pill you could buy at CVS so you could watch Star Wars and Harry Potter like it was your first time ever? I think about that a lot, and think about how awesome that would be. Please tell me some of you feel the same way as me!

aVI\u2019m having a hard time with the weather. It has been super nice here in LA. This means, t shirts, dresses, and shorts. I\u2019m more of a over sized sweater, boots, and a scarf (at all times!) type of person. So switching gears is something that I don\u2019t do well. I can\u2019t get rid of my scarf. Its like my security blanket. I just can\u2019t. This year though, I am going to try and wear normal person spring/summer shoes. Maybe more dresses instead of pants. The scarf situation, is one that I just can\u2019t give up. I have decided that I am going to find light beach scarves, and wear those. It is the issue I have with warm weather clothes as I have with food. I don\u2019t want to eat spa salads, sprouts, and other light stuff in spring and summer. I want my pasta and chowders. If you\u2019re like me, and holding onto the last bit of winter, lets all eat some ziti together and wear scarves.

aVHave you guys ever seen the movie Fried Green Tomatoes? I used to watch that movie over and over again when I discovered it as a teen. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it kind of helped shaped my personality. Idgie Threadgood, one of the main characters doesn\u2019t take crap from anybody. She is one of those characters you love because she is so stubborn, and does what she wants. Maybe she is kind of mean but its ok, because you love her anyway. I wanted to be that kind of person. Not a push over, tough, yet caring. I would hope that my friends today would describe me as such. Anyway, if you have not seen this movie you really should. Every time I think of a tomato I think of the movie. So here we give you Baked Tomatoes. No, they are not green, and not fried, but they are really pretty and make an awesome side dish.

For some reason, that clip is so perfect to me, I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. If you have not seen the trailer yet, you can see it

aVIt\u2019s smoothie time. Smoothies are kind of this awesome thing I forget about because my blender sucked so I gave it away. Frozen fruit is the whole reason smoothies are great. You can make a smoothie from stuff in your freezer. Its so easy and awesome! This Blueberry & Banana Buttermilk Smoothie has a bit of cinnamon in it, which really changes things up.

VHi All! So today is a sad day. Today Teri, her boyfriend and I begin a juice cleanse (notice how my boyfriend is not involved\u2026smart guy). Yep, it\u2019s true\u2026and I\u2019m SO nervous about it! Am I going to starve? Am I going to turn into a huge bitch for a few days? Will I be sprinting to the bathroom all day?!?! All these things have me really worried, but I guess I also see this as a little adventure\u2026.a hungry, sad adventure, ha! Why do it then? Eh, worth a shot. Why not! :)
p2673
aVI know, it\u2019s a little ironic that the same day we go on a major cleanse we post the most unhealthy, decadent, creamy thing we can think of\u2026.but it\u2019s just sort of wishful thinking, I guess. This is seriously one of my favorite pasta dishes\u2026EVER. It\u2019s SO good. Plus, this pasta seriously takes 15 minutes to throw together and you need a handful of ingredients! Please go put on your fat pants and make this dish. I definitely plan on doing so after this cleansing is all said and done. Does that defeat the purpose?..eh well :) Enjoy!

V\u000aHi All! Hope everyone\u2019s having a great week! Last week I talked about the need to \u201cdetox\u201d after a few days of indulging in \u201cawesome, but not so great for you\u201d foods. Today I have anther one of those no fuss, tasty \u201cdetox\u201d dishes. I love beets in all ways. I will eat them raw, roasted, steamed, pureed into a soup\u2026.I LOVE beets! Not only is this salad healthy and delicious, but it\u2019s super pretty too, right?? Also, the light and tangy vinaigrette pairs quite nicely with the assortment of veggies in this dish! If you\u2019re having a hard time finding black beets or red celery (which has only been around a couple of years), you can swap them out for more common, easy to find varieties. If you like beets, but the thought of eating them raw doesn\u2019t sound appealing to you, you can always slice them into 1/4 inch rounds, toss them in some oil, salt and pepper and grill them for a few minutes on each side. So good! Also, farmers markets everywhere in the states should be in full effect by now, so have a little fun with this dish and go pick up some great seasonal vegetables of your choice and toss them into the mix!
p2729
aVIf you haven\u2019t been making the best food decisions lately, guess what? It\u2019s totally okay\u2026so long as you squeeze dishes like this into your weekly rotation every now and then. That\u2019s what I think at least :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVIt\u2019s really awesome when two great things come together into one. For instance, R2D2 and C3PO, Harry Potter and magic, bread and butter, and corn and spoon bread. So, I give you: jalapeño cheddar spoon bread! This recipe is corn bread in a souffle pudding texture situation. Ok, i know what you\u2019re thinking. Why would I choose jalapeno cheddar spoon bread over regular corn bread? Well, let me tell you.
p2803
aV1. You can make spoon bread mountains or volcanoes on your dinner plate. (If you were a cool kid, you used to make these with mashed potatoes and peas. ).
p2804
aV2.  This makes an incredible base at the bottom of a bowl of chili.

aV4. The texture feels like silk deliciousness in your mouth.

aVHi All! Today we have beef satay for you! I love the potent flavors of lemongrass, ginger and lime, within most Thai style satays. If you\u2019re able to find kaffir limes and/or kaffir lime leaves use those to replace the lime zest/juice used in this recipe! Kaffir limes are sweeter and more mild than regular limes and the leaves are the best part! They\u2019re filled with this lovely citrus flavor which I may or may not have dabbed on my wrists one or two times to use are a perfume bc I love the smell so much (I\u2019m a creep, I know). Traditionally, beef satay is made with thin slices of beef, threaded onto a skewer and grilled, but we\u2019ve changed things up a bit by using a NY strip steak and cutting the pieces of meat into cubes. The cubes just make for \u201cmeatier\u201d (no pun intended) and more filling bites\u2026and we totally like 
p2863
aV over here. ;) These make great appetizers at a party or a great entree for a quiet night in. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the laundry list of ingredients! Most of the marinade and peanut sauce ingredients are repeats of one another and most of this recipe itself calls for throwing everything into a blender and blending away. So the next time you have guests over, why not treat them to some really yummy and easy to make, beef satay!

One of them being walking into the closet while I am in there looking for something, forcing his way into my teeny closet with me, closing the door, and declaring its \u201cseven minutes in heaven!\u201d Did I find this amusing? No. I was in the middle of something, doing complicated work stuff. I reached for the door handle and gave it a good twist. Nothing. \u201cHuh.\u201d I thought. Tried it a few more times, nothing. We got locked in. As I tried to turn the knob again and again, the knob came off in my hand. Trying to stick the knob back in the hole just pushes the handle from the other side out more. I knew if we lost that handle, we would be screwed. I ended up unscrewing the screws on the handle hardware with a pocketknife I had in my closet (again, don\u2019t ask). This whole process took about 30 minutes, complete with panicked text messages to Jenny and Adrianna, an awkward phone call to my neighbor that ended up being a long babbling nonsensical embarrassing voicemail, and tears of laughter. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t have to call the fire department.

aVThat story has absolutely nothing to do with baked polenta, so I won\u2019t even try to make some random connection. I do really love all the things in this recipe though. Polenta, goat cheese, Italian sausage, and cremini mushrooms. All together this will make for pretty darn good side dish to a lovely salad. Go for it.

aVLets talk about summer, and swimming. When I was kid I would go swim for hours and hours, and then order some awesome fried food and a sandwich from the snack shack. It was great. Pool food was always better when eaten after a good swim. If you ate pool food before swimming it was a mistake. First it would not taste as good, at all. I\u2019m pretty sure being covered in pool water made things taste better. Second, if you ate pool food before you swam, you would have to wait like 45 minutes before going into the pool. That waiting game is horrible for a kid. I would usually get one of two things, a grilled cheese, or a steak sandwich, both with curly fries (because who are we kidding, curly fries are the best kind of fries ever.) So when Jenny made this sandwich, the first thing that came to my mind was pool time. This last weekend in LA it was gross and muggy and hot. Prime time pool time for sure. I advise bringing this steak sandwich to your next pool outing and digging in after a big swim. I hope you guys like this, my favorite part is the hard boiled egg, it really makes it!

aVPanzenella Salad is for salad haters. It\u2019s like the best possible case scenario for a salad. This year for my birthday, Jenny made me dinner. She had talked to me about side dishes, and then brought up the word \u201csalad\u201d and asked what kind I liked best. \u201cMeh, I don\u2019t like salad.\u201d I said, and this is how I learned of Panzanella Salad.
p3091
aVThe thing with salads is that to me, they will never be as face melting as pork belly sliders or poutine. So why should I waste stomach space on it? I know, I know, I should because it\u2019s good for you. I know. I agree. Still doesn\u2019t mean I like it, or am happy about eating it. I am happy about eating sandwiches, and since Panzanella Salad is basically a salad made of a sandwich, I think it\u2019s the best salad ever.

I just have not been super excited about stuff.

This salad is very easy to throw together and the name pretty much speaks for itself\u2026it\u2019s awesome and really wonderful anytime of the year (plus, I couldn\u2019t think of a better name!). I love the bitterness of radicchio, especially paired with a sweet and tangy balsamic vinaigrette. The ingredients in this salad are pretty much based on my own personal preferences. It has both the earthiness of the beets and mixed greens and the hearty texture of the chickpeas which I think beings good balance to this salad overall\u2026.but feel free to swap out ingredients you don\u2019t like for ones you do!

aVHi Guys! We\u2019re 
p3304
aV happily continuing our healthy eating/living with another light and refreshing recipe! We have a seared ahi tuna dish that sits over a bed of mixed greens with lightly sauteed beech mushrooms and a ginger-miso dressing. I love seared ahi and wanted to try something a little different by mixing sesame seeds with almond meal. I loved the flavor the almonds added to the tuna, but I missed some of the crunch from the usual fully sesame seed coated steaks, so I switched the almond meal out for the medium ground almonds to get some of that crunchy texture back. The beech mushrooms add a nice hearty and earthiness to the overall dish. If you\u2019re not a fan on beech mushrooms or can\u2019t find them, feel free to use whatever mushrooms meet your fancy. This is such a fantastic dish because it can be thrown together in 10 or 15 minutes, and it\u2019s really filling. Great when you\u2019re short on time. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVHi Guys! It\u2019s the day before thanksgiving and I\u2019m sure everyone has their menus planned already. We have thanksgiving in Chicago, at my parents house, every year. It\u2019s kind of funny because when I tell people we have two full thanksgiving dinners, I don\u2019t just mean we eat turkey etc. and then nibble on the same thing a couple hours later, but we really have two whole separate meals. For the most part we have a traditional thanksgiving dinner with the usually suspects, turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, veggie sides, etc; that\u2019s dinner number one. About an hour after our turkey/ham dinner has settled in our stomachs (but not really because we tend to eat like gluttons) we have Korean dumpling soup, multiple banchans (Korean side dishes), multiple types of kimchi, a sushi platter, and a sashimi platter. About an hour after THAT we have dessert, usually consisting of multiple pies and a fruit platter. Is this strange? I used to say it was an asian thing, but I soon realized that not all my asian friends partake in the double meal ritual\u2026..so maybe it\u2019s just a Park family thing? Does anyone else have some not so traditional thanksgiving traditions? Whether food related or not?

aVHi Guys! Everyone seems to be jumping into the Thanksgiving spirit and we totally are as well. We\u2019re starting today with these crazy looking sweet potatoes. We have a really simple mashed sweet potato recipe for you today, using purple sweet potatoes, only because I found some at the market the other day and I love the intensity of the purple! If you can\u2019t find purple sweet potatoes or the color of them freak you out non-purple sweet potatoes work just fine. :) I\u2019m not a huge candied yam person so to me this is the perfect, slightly sweet alternative. Not so in your face sugar which is how I like it.
p3451
aVAs we all prepare for this upcoming time of reflection and thanks I think it\u2019s important to remember our loved ones back east, the devastation that has hit them and what we can do to do our part and help. Whether it\u2019s donating money, food, clothes, etc. every little bit counts. During this time, lets not forget about all our furry friends who also lost their homes, were separated from their families and have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on. They desperately need our love and compassion during this difficult time. You can donate for both people and animals through a large number of different organizations both established and created for this specific cause. I hope everyone has a wonderful and safe week!

We love how hearty the food can be, like their meat pies! Who doesn\u2019t love a good meat pie? Did you guys know they also have a special little something called a sausage roll?! It\u2019s basically a flavorful meat mixture stuffed inside a rich, buttery, flaky crust\u2026does it get much better? We don\u2019t think so. This Australian Lamb & Sausage Roll is usually made with pork sausage or ground beef or both, but we changed ours up by mixing up some ground lamb as well as some mild Italian pork sausage\u2026.nothing too fancy or fussy. You guys can head on over to MYHABIT\u2019s

aVI had never really messed around in the kitchen with clams until last year when I started becoming obsessed with paella. Now, I am pretty into them, and this recipe we have for you today is like a delicious clam dream. First lets talk about when a clam made me scream. I didn\u2019t know this, obviously because I am naive concerning clams, but they can move in their little shells. I was preparing my seafood for my paella and scrubbing the shells of my clams. Some of clams had little bits of seaweed sticking out the seams. I decided it would be a good idea to just pull the little bit of seaweed out. Instead what happened, is 
p3520
aV pulled the seaweed back into its clam, and there by shifting it\u2019s weight in the shell, and there by seriously freaking me out. I dropped the little guy into the sink and screamed and ran. This, is sad. I feel stupid screaming, I feel stupid not knowing. When things move in your hands you don\u2019t think should move it is scary, so at least give me that. Now that I have told you my story, hopefully you newbies with clams will be aware of the fact that these things can happen. I leave you with Coconut & Green Curry Steamed Clams.

aVThere are two kinds of people, people who turn red when they are embarrassed, and people that do not. I can feel the blood travel from torso into my face when I am embarrassed enough to turn red, and I know it is happening. There is nothing I can do about it, and it sucks. The thing about turning red is you can\u2019t just act cool and that what just happened wasn\u2019t embarrassing because everyone knows you are embarrassed. Your face is red. Yesterday at the gym I had a face turning red incident. Like a lot of people, I have an iPhone Velcro sleeve thing that makes me look like a power ranger and a playlist aptly titled \u201cwork out\u201d that contains a bunch of songs that help try and get into doing cardio.  While in the locker room sliding my iPhone into my armband thing, the music started playing really loud, and it was a monstrously inappropriate rap song. So so so inappropriate. I tried to swiftly make the music stop but of course my iPhone chose that moment to have a meltdown and so it took an extra couple of seconds to get it to stop. I could feel the heat of the all the naked women in the locker room staring at me questioning my offensive taste in music. Horrible. My face was so red, there was just no way I could play it cool. I ended up just staring at the floor, mumbling sorry, and getting out of there. Ugh. Anyway\u2026

aVSo we all know it\u2019s flu season and people are getting sick left and right. We wanted to share a new sick soup with you. This egg drop soup is for people who are getting sick of chicken noodle, it could also be for people who just want a really cozy soup to eat while they watch this crazy storm brewing outside their windows. I hope everyone stays safe, and uses this as an excuse to make lots of yummy food.

VThere is nothing better than taking that first bite of a warm fluffy biscuit after depriving yourself of carbs because your thighs are huge. God I love bread, and chips, and everything carb, and biscuits. We have this wonderful easy biscuit recipe today. So easy to make, and a little bit sturdier than a flaky biscuit which is kind of nice because then you can totally build delicious breakfast sandwiches with them, or eat them on the couch and watch Girls and not get any huge crumbs down your shirt. I love these Sour Cream & Chive Drop Biscuits. I hope you do too.

aVHi Guys! Growing up I hated the taste of anything black licorice\u2026.like REALLY hated. I think it all started when my family and I were walking out of a restaurant that offered those candies in the front that look like teensy, misshaped m&m\u2019s, but that are actually candy coated sunflower seeds, sometimes flavored with black licorice. I eagerly spooned a big pile into my hand, leaned my head back, opened wide, and down my piehole they went. One minute later I was coughing up and choking on seeds, candy coating and the powerful taste of black licorice\u2026.NOT teeny-tiny m&m\u2019s. Now, when you\u2019re expecting smooth, creamy milk chocolate and you unexpectedly get a giant mouthful of licorice\u2026.major vom.
p3704
aVAnyway, that experience pretty much scarred me for life and I had kept away from black licorice-like things ever since\u2026.that is until I attended culinary school. We were working with fennel one day, which I had already deemed as foul, grossy-grossness. My chef knew about my aversion to licorice/anise like things and introduced me to grilled fennel, finished with a star anise gastrique\u2026so pretty much a heaping mouthful of stuff I didn\u2019t like\u2026licorice on licorice, great. I took one bite and my mind was blown. I didn\u2019t need the giant glass of water I had prepped for when I would presumably begin to choke! I actually LOVED it! Grilling the fennel brought out the natural sweetness and adding an acid to the anise sauce really softened the intense flavor. These days I love all things with the flavor of anise/black licorice\u2026except the candy. I still cant handle that stuff, but I do love cooking/baking with star anise and well as eating fennel in a variety of ways. My favorite way is still grilling them, which is what we have for you today! Grilled fennel tarts! These little guys are so simple and really delicious. The cheese and herb spread on the bottom has just enough richness to cut through the strong fennel flavor, but doesn\u2019t overbear it. They\u2019re great appetizers for get-togethers, but what I really like doing is pairing the tarts with a simple mixed greens salad and enjoying it as a light meal. I hope everyone has a great weekend\u2026perhaps making and eating some grilled fennel tarts?! :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny

I love their creamy texture, with the hints of natural sweetness they carry\u2026so good. I love cooking with them, but more so I love love love baking with them. When you bake with potatoes it\u2019s like adding instant moisture to whatever it is you\u2019re making. We made 
p3767
aV a little while back and they\u2019re one of my favorite kinds of doughnuts\u2026.with the cutest name, Spudnut! Super cute, right? Not only does baking with sweet potato add a smooth texture and tons of moisture, but they also add a gorgeous orange tinge to whatever it is you\u2019re making as well.
p3768
aVAnyways, back to these Sweet Potato & Rosemary Biscuits. I love them. Really. They don\u2019t rise quite like regular biscuits because I\u2019ve added so much potato to this (for fluffier biscuits scale back on the sweet potato and add more flour), but they taste amazing! The rosemary is just an added bonus that go really well with the sweet potato. These are best eaten plain, with a schmear of butter or dipped in a nice, thick soup or chowder, like

I love desserts like this because they seem really impressive, but are actually super easy to throw together and require minimal ingredients\u2026.plus, who doesn\u2019t like sweet, warm fruit paired with a light and buttery crust for dessert, right?? This dessert is great anytime, but I really love making this if I\u2019m having friends over during the week. I barely have anytime to brush my own hair during the week, let alone cook a feast for friends, but when I do invite people over for dinner during the week, this dessert is a life saver. I don\u2019t have to prep anything out ahead of time (although I usually like cutting up the strawberries a few hours before, so they\u2019re ready to go) and I can whip this up from the time dishes are being brought to the kitchen and until people are ready for a night cap. You can also use other fruit like bananas or peaches, I used strawberries because they\u2019ve been really cheap at the markets lately and I love adding a touch of rosemary to desserts, when appropriate, for that small boost of fragrance and flavor. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this super easy and delicious tarte tatin. xx, Jenny

aV2. Place butter into a small saucepan and melt over medium-high heat. Add sugar and stir together. Allow mixture to come to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and lightly boil for an additional 5 minutes. Add vanilla. Cinnamon and cloves and stir together.
p3860
aV3. Pour mixture into an 8\u201dx 8\u201d baking dish (nonstick is best) and spread evenly across the surface. Top the caramel mixture with a sprinkle of rosemary, followed by the strawberries, cut side down in a single layer.

aV4. Gently lay puff pastry over strawberries and tuck edges down each side of the baking dish.
p3862
aV5. Prick the surface of the puff pastry with a fork and bake for 17 to 22 minutes or until golden brown. Allow tarte tatin to rest for 3 minutes before quickly but carefully inverting onto a plate. (Tapping the bottom of the baking dish before lifting it up will help to release the tarte tatin).

aVHi guys! We\u2019ve had a weird spike in temp out here in LA and we\u2019re up to about 80 degrees F! This calls for an early spring celebration\u2026.grill radicchio. Grilled vegetables in general\u2026.so yum. I love grilling vegetables because t\u2019s so easy and the results are always good\u2026always. You get this natural smokey flavor from grilling your veg and with a light brush of some melted butter and balsamic?! Whoa so good. Sorry, just having a grilled veggie moment. :) Anyway, this radicchio me loves! I love the bitterness of radicchio, the great crunch it gives and the slightest bit of sweetness that tends to linger in your mouth, especially when grilled/charred. The grilling also softens the overall bitter flavor for those of you not so into those flavor notes. The balsamic drizzle is like radicchio\u2019s soulmate. So good. You don\u2019t have to add the honey by any means; the balsamic will thicken and sweeten up quite nicely on its own, but I like adding a touch of honey every now and then because it adds a \u201cbarely there, but glad it\u2019s there\u201d type of taste where the reduced balsamic doesn\u2019t seem as molasses-like.

aVI know the grilling might be a little for some of you out there, but it\u2019s fun to think that spring is right around the corner! Bye! xx, Jenny

aVAs an adult I love mushrooms. As a child, I hated them. I think that parents who claim their kid is a picky eater are maybe feeding them things that are gross. Case in point, I hated mushrooms. So gross. Ew. Yuck. That is because the only mushrooms I had ever come into contact with were button mushrooms. Button mushrooms in my opinion, taste like weeds and dirt. I think they are the worst of the mushroom options. So knowing this, as an adult, I wasn\u2019t super optimistic about trying different kinds of mushrooms. When I finally did, it was a life changer. Now I love mushrooms (the right kinds) on everything, and in everything. I always buy crazy mushrooms at the farmers market, and this is the perfect dish to utilize them. This is a super quick and easy perfect for dinner pasta dish. Rigatoni with a wild mushroom crema sauce. I\u2019m excited about it, and I can\u2019t wait to make it again! Yum!

aVI am really excited to present to you this great free form Potatoes Au Gratin. I would like to think of myself as a potato aficionado (It\u2019s the Idaho in me!). Whenever I am at breakfast and the side choices are salad and potatoes, it\u2019s potatoes. Obviously. No question. Eating a sandwich? Put potato chips on it! Getting a burger? French fries on the side, or inside for that matter. Potatoes Au Gratin bring back a lot of memories for me. I used to work at this French restaurant in college, we had these amazing creamy Potatoes Au Gratin, and we would run out on busy days on occasion and people would have meltdowns because the only other thing I could offer them is a side salad. I got it, I understood, you come to a restaurant expecting to have a delicious side of Potatoes Au Gratin and instead get offered a salad. I always felt horrible. I remember asking one of the chefs the secret to their Au Gratin, and it was to make sure you let the potatoes sit in the cream for a long time. This allows the starchiness of the potato to exude and really marry into the cream. Our recipe calls for 5 minutes if you happen to be short on time, and because our slices are thin. If you have the time you can make slightly thicker slices and really let them soak up that cream. I love the concept of the free form because I think it just looks so beautiful and organic. Plus, the crunchy sides I believe are the best part. We are serving ours with a béarnaise sauce because it just really makes this dish such a treat, and I for one love the added richness. Enjoy!

aVI went through this strange phase in college where for a long period of time, longer than I am willing to admit, I ate candied carrots, and nothing else\u2026 Except Dr. Pepper. I had a poor diet, but for some reason I was really really into candied carrots. After candied carrots, it was sliced tomatoes with salt. It was one of those weird phases in my life where I think I was subcoinciously trying to see if one could survive on nothing but carrots and Dr. Pepper. The answer is that you can, but your skin will probably turn a weird color. That is what happened when I OD\u2019ed on carrots. Anyway, so obiviously being a big fan of carrots I love this dish. So this great little simple dish is the perfect side for nearly anything, and it\u2019s so pretty!

VI went through this strange phase in college where for a long period of time, longer than I am willing to admit, I ate candied carrots, and nothing else\u2026 Except Dr. Pepper.
p4130
aVI had a poor diet, but for some reason I was really really into candied carrots.
p4131
aVAfter candied carrots, it was sliced tomatoes with salt.
p4132
aVIt was one of those weird phases in my life where I think I was subcoinciously trying to see if one could survive on nothing but carrots and Dr. Pepper.

VWe\u2019re going to be getting into summer months soon and that means long days at the beach, barbecues, ice cold beers, and one of our favorites things\u2026.picnics! When we think about getting one of our summer picnics together we usually like to consider food that are refreshing, cooling, delicious, and above all dishes that will hold and travel well. We\u2019re back with our friends at The Fix with a really easy and totally yummy Hawaiian-style macaroni salad. We\u2019re stressing the Hawaiian-style aspect of it because there\u2019s a special ingredient that is always added to give it its luscious almost umami like flavor and it\u2019s bonito flakes! (or you can also sub a little bit of canned tuna and it\u2019ll be just as good). This teeny addition of bonito or tuna flavor really kicks up a plain mac salad, but if you\u2019re not a fish fan it\u2019s okay because the hints of flavor are super subtle and it\u2019s almost difficult to detect what it is\u2026other than really tasty! We highly recommend you all hop on over to The Fix and check out our perfect

VYou know when you\u2019re a kid and people would always tell you that you\u2019ll understand and appreciate your parents much more when we\u2019re older? Well people (including my own parents) always told me that and I really hated hearing it. It was during a time in my life when my adolescent self thought I knew everything there was to know in the world and my mom was my mortal enemy. I was convinced it was her sole purpose in life to ruin mine. I mean how dare she \u201cforce\u201d me to do after school activities and \u201cforce\u201d me to go to Korean language class every SATURDAY morning\u2026.didn\u2019t she know I had a very important (13 year old\u2019s) social life?! Ugh, if I didn\u2019t like doing something why wouldn\u2019t she just let me quit after a day? Really mom, no sleepovers unless it\u2019s a special occasion? WHO ARE YOU?!
p4177
aVIt\u2019s a funny thing, this growing business. I graduated high school thinking I can\u2019t WAIT to get away from here (and HER); then I got to college, my mom helped me settle into my dorm, flew home, and I was forced to be somewhat independent. Suddenly all I wanted to do was see my mom, talk to her, get her advice, etc. Once I had settled into college life it\u2019s like all that \u201cunderstanding and appreciation\u201d talk came true. I started thanking my lucky stars that I had a mom who always encouraged me to try new things\u2026ice skating? Sure! basketball? Yes, honey! Clay sculpting class? Of course! As long as my sister and I were being productive, she was all for it. How cool. Even today, I kick myself and hate that I didn\u2019t pay better attention during Korean school and that my Korean speaking and understanding abilities are sadly nowhere near where they should be.
p4178
aVToday, I don\u2019t think I can get through the week without daily phone chats with mom about how her grand-pup is doing and just pretty much shooting the shit. Never did I think in a million years that my mom would be someone I respect most in the world and one of my best friends (not in the creepy, she\u2019s trying to act too young for her age type of way). :) She\u2019s such a big part of my overall support system and I love her everyday for it.
p4179
aVMy mom\u2019s a bit of a health nut and she loves vegetables and simples flavors, so today I have a dish dedicated to my mama. Simple roasted radishes. Easy, fresh, clean flavors. If you\u2019ve never roasted or cooked with radishes, imagine something similar to a turnip. It\u2019s pretty mild and once roasted the slight bitter taste goes away and produces a subtle sweetness. I hope everyone has a great Mother\u2019s Day this weekend celebrating all the amazing mama\u2019s out there! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

I don\u2019t really like the kind that uses a whole bottle of mayo. It\u2019s just too much. It becomes more about the mayo texture than about the potatoes. Gross. The other issue I feel like I have run across is not enough seasoning. So it just tastes like really bland and like you bought it at a grocery store. Ew. So now if you have those issues with potato salad I present you with this solution. This potato salad is mayo free, and simple and yummy, which I why I love it, and why I think it\u2019s perfect for summer. Head on over the

VHey Guys! Today we have another great picnic sandwich for you, Bocadillo Bites! Bocadillo are Spanish style sandwiches served on a crusty baguette. They\u2019re usually pretty basic sandwiches that can be filled with anything from omelets to cold cuts to sweets.
p4223
aVI had this particular type of Bocadillo in Spain years ago although I think the peppers were different. I remember looking at the sandwich with lack luster thoughts, wishing I had some mustard and mayonnaise to slather between layers of what seemed to be a dry and sad looking sandwich. I was so wrong and pleasantly surprised! The uber simple sandwich was delicious, full of flavor and perfectly filling. For something so simple it was perfectly balanced.
p4224
aVI was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu of one of my favorite, local (Southbay) restaurants, Abigaile. If you like Manhattan Beach Post I highly recommend Abigaile. The food is wonderful; from their hamachi sashimi to their roasted bone marrow, and even bocadillo bites. :) I also love that they brew their own craft beer and serve super delicious scratch cocktails. When I ordered the bocadillo bites it took me right back to a hot August afternoon in Barcelona, at the beach with my family playing games and munching on this tasty treat.
p4225
aVOur version is super simple and doesn\u2019t really require a proper recipe, but we\u2019ve given you one anyway just as a reference. This sandwich packs up and holds extremely well, making it perfect for picnics or on the go lunches. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V\u000aDid everyone have a good weekend? This weekend was the first time I was able to have a full two days off of work and it was glorious. I\u2019ve been on shoots nonstop for the past  4 weeks and I was just about ready to crash. Thankful I was able to sit back and relax this weekend\u2026 plus the boyfriend was in Vegas so this pretty much means I laid around in bed all weekend with my Dexter. We went to the dog park, took plenty of daytime naps together and he ran a couple errands with me. It was the perfect weekend.
p4263
aVSince I did so much laying around, I didn\u2019t get much of anything productive accomplished. I think the most productive thing I did was make myself this Lobster & Corn Pasta. Yes, I had a \u2018dinner for one\u2019 kind of night on Saturday and I decided it was time for me to treat myself. Rarely do I ever cook fancy meals when it\u2019s just me; I\u2019m lucky if I can convince myself to prepare more than just a box of crackers and some cheese for myself when I eat alone. This weekend was different. This weekend was all about me and that meant cooking myself a fancy meal.
p4264
aVI\u2019m usually not the biggest lobster fan. Like I don\u2019t really get a craving for it, but last weekend I wanted lobster and I wanted pasta, so I did a 2 in 1 sort of thing. I learned to combine lobster, corn and tarragon together in the first restaurant I worked in (and p.s. best combo ever\u2026the sweetness of the lobster and corn against the bright and powerful anise flavor of tarragon\u2026so good!) I was in charge of prepping our ravioli and it was the most delicious combination of lobster, mascarpone, corn, pimentos, and tarragon. I probably ate that dish every shift I worked. Heaven\u2026except for my poor waistline. Anyway, this pasta is sort of a tribute to that magical ravioli dish. I usually wouldn\u2019t think of pairing this sort of mature sauce with such a playful pasta like fusilli, but I love just much how of the sauce is absorbed by the ridges of the fusilli! You get a burst of creamy, delicious sauce in every single corkscrew, it\u2019s great.
p4265
aVI think this is definitely the perfect pasta to make when you want to treat a loved one to something special, or when you\u2019re just in the mood to \u2018treat yoself\u2019! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VJenny and I are jetting off on a quick little business / pleasure trip next week and I could not be more excited to have a tiny little break. I need one pretty bad because little things are starting to set me off. Like when my landlord comes and blocks the entire driveway to everyone that lives here instead of pulling up into an empty parking spot to water the \u2018front lawn\u2019 which is really dirt. Or when you\u2019re at the vet and the crazy lady next to you asks what is wrong with your cat, and you tell her, and she responds with \u201cmaybe it\u2019s just time to let go, you know?\u201d At that moment in time I could only picture myself as Grumpy Cat and the word NO floating above my head in all caps while my expression says everything. So me being a grumpy cat these days, all I want to do is watch Nashville on TV and eat snacks. Lucky for me (and you) we have this fall inspired Savory Pumpkin Hummus. I really love hummus situations because it\u2019s so easy make. This one with pumpkin is my new favorite. The pumpkin is such a nice departure from your typical hummus flavor and I really love the flavor of this savory hummus with the garlic and cinnamon. So satisfying! Excuse me while I pig out on my new found love of Savory Pumpkin Hummus and try to de-grumpify myself. Bye!

VHi Guys! I hope everyone had a great thanksgiving! I\u2019m sure everyone is stuffed and fridges are loaded up with leftovers. Last year we suggested you all make these with your leftover sweet potatoes or yams and this year we have the most simple and delicious after turkey day snack\u2026.using your leftover mashed potatoes (these will also work if you have mashed sweet potatoes)\u2026they\u2019re mashed potato chips! Okay, so they\u2019re duchess potatoes (with a fun little name), but really what\u2019s better than a little bite of star shaped potatoes that are crisp on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside? Not too much. So if you\u2019re looking for something quick and easy to do with those leftover mashed spuds sitting in the fridge\u2026.maybe some mashed potato chips are calling your name.

VHi Guys! Thank you so much for all the wonderful advice for my run this Sunday\u2026we\u2019ll see how it goes! Our last new recipe before the big game (you know, the puppy bowl) is a wedge salad. Man, I really love these things. I know a lot of people turn their nose up to iceberg lettuce, but I love it. I love its crisp-juiciness\u2026is that a thing? Who knows. All I know is that I love iceberg and I love a good wedge salad. I also feel like if there\u2019s going to be any \u201csalad\u201d at all, sitting around on Sunday\u2026shouldn\u2019t it be one with salty, crispy prosciutto? that\u2019s also drowning in a gallon of rich and creamy bleu cheese dressing? Me thinks so. If you don\u2019t fancy a wedge salad, maybe delicious

VHi Guys! Thanks again for everyone\u2019s awesome support with my 5k. It was GREAT! We had a lot of fun and actually did okay. We both came in at 30:39\u2026not the best time (by a loooooong shot) but we\u2019re happy with it. Now it\u2019s just prepping for the 10k in Santa Barbara next month\u2026..we\u2019ll see how it goes!
p4506
aVSo we\u2019ve totally been MIA from the blog and we apologize. We have a few things in the works sucking up all our time at the moment, but can\u2019t wait to share them with you lovelies in the near and not so near future! Today we have a little something for a last minute, quick and easy v-day dessert. A simple sparkling sabayon! It\u2019s a great dessert for those of you planning on staying in Friday night, like my dude and I\u2026hello takeout and House of Cards marathon!! I love this dessert because it only requires three ingredients and literally takes no more than 10 minutes to make, start to finish. PLUS, you can just spoon this stuff into your mouth for a sweet, frothy, delightful treat or spoon some onto fresh fruit like we\u2019ve done today.
p4507
aVThe recipe actually results in a pretty thick, sit atop the fruit, froth, but since I let the mixture sit for a little while before we photographed it (whoops), some of the air in the Sabayon died. It\u2019s all good though because it has no effect on the taste and I usually like mixing it all up together anyway.
p4508
aVWe hope everyone has a great time celebrating or not celebrating V-Day and encourage you to try your hand at this totally easy and delicious dessert! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VI have a new found love in veggies because of roasting. Getting a really nice crispy skin on some root veg really lets the flavor of the veggies come through. It makes steaming veggies seem so gross now to me. I actually don\u2019t think I will ever steam veggies again. So after roasting lots of veggies lately, it\u2019s fun to mix things up. Today we have these Thyme Roasted Parsnips and Apples. Apples are something I hadn\u2019t originally thought of adding into my roasting repertoire, but it\u2019s such a nice addition. It adds such a lovely sweetness to this dish. I am also kinda in love with the colors of this dish. Aren\u2019t they amazing?! Check out below for a giveaway with

My boyfriend, who normally gags at the sight of the stuff, was LOVING it! The subtle sweetness combined with hints of fresh ocean salt\u2026.SO GOOD. I\u2019ve made my own version of this dish many times since, because it\u2019s just that good. I know, I know, you get it so I\u2019ll stop now. Enjoy!

aVIt was one of those days where you feel fat and think that everyone sucks. I was picking up a friend from the airport, and she was trying to convince me to go and eat with her at the Grove Farmers Market. I did NOT feel like doing this at all. It was a day when everything and everyone is annoying and I just wanted to go home and watch Harry Potter and be a nerd on the computer and not talk to anyone. I was beginning to think people were generally bad, and have no manners. I was just kinda down. Do you ever have these days?  I was finally able to be convinced to go eat. We drove into the parking lot of the farmers market, I found a spot, put my signal on and waited for them to back out. They did, and then BAM, my spot got swiped. HELLO! MY SIGNAL WAS ON! So that was annoying. AND RUDE. I also got called a mean name by a lady because I had no money to give her. This was both shocking and hilarious. Anyway, we make our way into the farmers market. Its an interesting place. Its filled with both good food, bad food, touristy crap, hot sauce, boba, stickers, cowboy hats, candy, and pretty much anything else you can think of. Its a weird spot. 
p4702
aV is one of those good food places. Like I mentioned before, I was having a fat day, so these tacos were perfect. Vegetarian, light, and fracking delicious. Seriously. Get this, and get the limeaid. This place also has a lot of other delicious items, but I swear by these tacos, and only really get them when I eat here. You will find our interpretation of this recipe below. Perfect for summer, and fat days. Okay, so the moral of the story. If you\u2019re having a bad day, and think people are generally bad, you will inevitably dwell on things that make people bad, as opposed to not paying attention to it like you would any other day. Its like a trap. So if you\u2019re having a negative Nancy kinda day, try to get a little perspective and power through it. Also, if you\u2019re having a fat day, make these tacos. Also, if someone does a favor for you, no matter how small, make sure you say thank you. Manners are nice and appreciated.

aVLuna Lovegood is by far my favorite Harry Potter character. Those weird glasses she wears that lets her see things, her cravings for pudding, just her all around weirdness I enjoy. She is by far the best Harry Potter character. I don\u2019t care what you say. Also, yes, I watch Harry Potter. No, I\u2019m not ashamed. They are good movies, reeeeaaaaally good movies.
p4834
aVIts a bit of a love affair situation I have going on. I got hooked on these movies and watch them over and over. I think its because they are so visually intense and inspiring. Each time I watch them I find something new, something I didn\u2019t see before that sparks excitement and a creative mojo that can only be described as epic. Sometimes its color combinations, sometimes its compositions. It doesn\u2019t matter really, what matters is that I (and probably many others) are creatively inspired.
p4835
aVOk, maybe the story line in the movies isn\u2019t the most amazing, and there are other things I could point out as well. But all that doesn\u2019t matter to me. Its the costumes, the fracking ah-mazing set design, the hair and make up, that is what I love, that is why I keep coming back for more. ANYWAY. Luna loves pudding and so do I. So here is a Luna Lovegood inspired recipe for you.

aVHi All! In honor of the final HP movie Teri and I thought it would be fun to create recipes around our favorite HP characters (totally nerdy, yet totally awesome). I know, I know. We\u2019re late. Forgive us. Last week Teri wrote about her favorite character, Luna Lovegood. When Teri asked me to write a recipe for \u201cLuna\u2019s Pudding\u201d I was excited! When she told me she wanted a recipe to make enough pudding to fill a large trifle I thought to myself, \u201cHm\u2026that\u2019s weird\u201d\u2026.but that\u2019s Teri, so very wonderfully weird :)

aVI don\u2019t know what it is about breakfast, but I love it. Well, let me rephrase that. I love breakfast foods. I actually don\u2019t have a very big appetite in the morning, but I love breakfast foods in general and can really eat it anytime of the day. There\u2019s something so comforting about pancakes, waffles, bacon (duh), eggs, pastries, fruit and yogurt, oatmeal (well not really, I hate oatmeal\u2026sorry, I know a lot of you are probably disgusted with me right now and I apologize\u2026but the stuff\u2019s like glue to me\u2026I\u2019ll take warm buttered grits over oatmeal any day).

You could easily swap the bacon out for crumbled breakfast sausage if that\u2019s your preference OR just add both to the pasta, which is my personal preference!

aVTo me, meh stuffing is about as common as hearing the Duggars are having another child. I don\u2019t like it when my bread crumb situations are too soggy, or if the stuffing is too salty, or if there isn\u2019t enough different textures. Souping everything in gravy doesn\u2019t save everything all the time. So this is why I\u2019m a little excited about this recipe. Sausage is always awesome, I don\u2019t think you can ever have too much meat. The awesome thing about this recipe is the crunch the hazelnuts give it. Its also just really pretty. This is legit stuffing. Legit enough for Thanksgiving. Boom.

aVHi all! We decided to make a Korean style dish called Bo Ssam where the pork is usually steamed, thinly sliced and served alongside a number of sides and condiments. We thought it would be fun to add more flavor to the pork itself by brining and roasting the pork shoulder and glazing it with the sweet and deeply flavorful syrup.
p5612
aVNot only is this a fairly easy dish to make, despite the seemingly intimidating number of ingredients and components, it\u2019s a great dish to serve for a get together with a naturally beautiful presentation. We took our photos and excitedly started eating our finished product. Bo Ssam is something that\u2019s actually surprisingly light and refreshing despite the use of roasted pork. There are so many different layers of flavor in this dish from the sweet and salty pork, to the umami-ness of the perilla leaves.
p5613
aVThe syrup really added a great touch of sweetness, against the salty brine, as well a a nice caramelized crust to the pork. We were pretty much eating that pork for days, with everything, and it was awesome. This dish is also super fun because of all the other added elements you can choose to pair with your pork. Most dishes that come to mind when we think of pork are rather heavy. This is actually lighter, and more refreshing. So go get all your cute small dishes out and make this!

aVHello! Everyone have a great Thanksgiving?! Every year I spend thanksgiving in Chicago (my hometown). I don\u2019t get to make it home often, but Thanksgiving is a time I NEVER miss\u2026why? Because my parents host Thanksgiving every yr and it\u2019s just awesome\u2026plain and simple awesome. I\u2019m really close to my family and spending time with them is something I cherish more than anything. This yr was extra special because everyone was in town. My sister and her husband flew in from D.C, Jordan (my bf), Dexter (our little baby pooch) and I all came in from LA and we got to spend some much needed catch up time with some of my aunts, uncles and cousins and their new wives. Not to mention, its been nothing but an eating, drinking and bonding fest (with some golf playing here and there) ALL WEEK LONG! Oh and since we\u2019re Korean my parents like to have all the traditional turkey day fixin\u2019s , but they also always make sure to have a large spread of Korean food as well\u2026so on top of turkey, ham, stuffing, potatoes, veg etc we have dumpling soup, all the Korean side dishes and massive sushi platters\u2026it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve totally been in my happy place this week\u2026.oh did I mention that my parents have two dogs of their own?\u2026and that some of our relatives and family friends who have dogs have been bringing them over too?\u2026yea, so we\u2019ve had a minimum of three dogs constantly running around and its been pure chaotic BLISS!
p5740
aVAnyway, everyone always asks me in a very assuming way, \u201cOh so you pretty much make thanksgiving dinner every year, right?\u201d They\u2019re surprised to learn that no, I most certainly do not. I mean yes, I help out. I\u2019ve made the turkey before (Alton Brown\u2019s recipe is THE BEST), I always seem to do the potatoes etc, but here\u2019s the thing\u2026.I write recipes and cook for a living and sometimes a girl just wants to take a break. Well that and the fact that I will never be able to get enough of my mom\u2019s home cooking. EVER.  One thing I make sure to do every single yr, every Friday afternoon after t-giving is make this\u2026Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches, my second favorite sandwich after the banh mi. Yep, I know thanksgiving turkey sandwiches are great, but nothing new\u2026BUT have you ever had one with a MOIST MAKER?! Yes, this is a nerdy \u201cFriends\u201d thing. The first time I learn about Monica Gellar\u2019s moist maker, I thought it was pure genius. Placing a slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle? OMG! Other than the fact that I hate the word \u201cmoist\u201d everything about this sandwich is real legit\u2026.like really. It\u2019s also one of the best ways to use your leftovers. Just don\u2019t bring it to work and leave it in the office fridge or 
p5741
aV might happen to you\u2026and that would be sad.
p5742
aVOkay enough of my rambling, sorry all, I know I ramble\u2026but can\u2019t help it!  I do hope everyone had an amazing Thanksgiving full of love, laughter, great eats and plenty of booze!  Cheers!

aVThis is the perfect recipe for that 30 minute cure. It\u2019s one of my favorite Korean dishes! Savory, short-ribby goodness, swimming in a sweet, soy broth with hearty root vegetables. I\u2019ve changed my mama\u2019s recipes just a tad. I added shiitake mushrooms, which many versions have. This recipe is also often made with water chestnuts, but I\u2019m not a big fan. Again, this recipe won\u2019t change your life, but it will make you pretty happy for a little while. Enjoy!

Don\u2019t even try and get all fancy and pronounce it poh-ta-toh. Everyone will hate you if you do that, its also really annoying.

aVWhen I was in college (Art Center REPRESENT!) I lived in South Pasadena. I was, and still am a huge breakfast person. In fact I prefer to eat a huge breakfast, and a smaller dinner. It makes more sense to me, and I also constantly wake up super hungry. I also think I was partial to breakfast back then because we spent ridiculously long hours in the photo lab inhaling chemicals (that I think when I am old will give me some weird issue, like my toenails turning silver or something). We would come out of the lab and go straight to sleep. Its those long hour of such intense concentration we would all forget to eat. So getting up to start another day working, breakfast was the one part of my day where I could actually decompress, think about future projects, or less important things like what kind of shellac I could buy to keep my nail polish from chipping so quick. I pretty much always went to 
p5991
aV in South Pasadena. If you\u2019re lucky enough to go there on a Saturday or Sunday you can get their Red Flannel Hash. It is seriously one of the best potato dish I have ever had. The beets dye all the potatoes an awesome red color, and also disguises the most awesome ingredient, bacon. I am so glad we are sharing our take on this recipe with you. You should all do yourself a favor, and when the craziness of the holidays settle down, make this and sit and think about stupid things. Its my favorite think to do.

aV Dessert Pizza. I get it, it may seem strange to some people. It is, its a weird idea, but I think its a glorious one. The closest thing I can think of is Pizza Huts (or maybe Dominos?) has these cinnamon sugar bread sticks. Now, while I dislike having to compare this recipe to those pizza places, I am doing so in an attempt to get you into your comfort zone. This is bomb. Blueberries, cinnamon sugar, cream cheese, mozzarella, it is actually really good. So I hope you will look upon these images, and this recipe and think it would be a good idea to make this. I am going to ask for it as my birthday cake.

aVHi All! So we\u2019re ending this week with a little something called the 50/50 burger. I had this burger for the first time at this place called 
p6183
aV. It\u2019s a burger place that acts sort of like a pub/sports bar. They have a great selection of burgers and beers to accompany them. Anyway, this burger is awesome. When I make this I like to use applewood smoked bacon with a hint of sweet maple. The type of bacon you use is important because it\u2019s what flavors your burgers. I do recommend that you actually grind the bacon and not just chop it up bc it\u2019ll mix and allow the fat to distribute more evenly which is so important when it comes time to cooking the patties. I also ground my own sirloin, but you certainly don\u2019t have to\u2026.don\u2019t have a meat grinder at home? It\u2019s okay, you can ask your local butcher or go to a specialty market and they\u2019re usually pretty good about doing it for you. If you have no choice, you can throw it in the food processor\u2026but make sure the bacon is partially to almost fully frozen, if not the fat will probably get stuck in the blade and not actually grind up (the bacon should be partially frozen when using any method including a meat grinder and mincing with a knife).
p6184
aVI love things like burgers because you can make them however you want and dress it exactly how you like it. I highly recommend you all go make this burger this weekend (and have it with a few cold beers, of course) it\u2019s simple, easy and burgers are awesome\u2026especially this one! :)

Look on the bright side, we have this wonderful breakfast recipe for you, and you can go home and snuggle on the couch and watch Office Space after work. You could also go home and make this recipe.  It will make  you feel good. Eggs, delicious gravy, fried steak!!!! YES! OR you can just look forward to making it this weekend all week. Have fun.

It\u2019s such a great way to relax and sort of get lost in thought. Sometimes we\u2019ll make up random and funny stories about the people passing by, just to entertain ourselves. Nerdy, yes. Entertaining, absolutely.

Not only is this milkshake awesome because it\u2019s pretty and pink, but also because it has actual poundcake in it. Oh, and the roasted strawberries\u2026totally awesome and delicious. Roasting them adds depth to this fun dessert. So regardless of what you do this Valentine\u2019s Day, make sure to include this tasty  and super simple shake into a part of your day! Seriously.

aVHi All! So today we have some pretty chicken lettuce wraps for you. We\u2019re trying to keep things a little lighter this week (okay, so chicken lettuce wraps might not be the most healthy thing, but since its wrapped in cups of lettuce, it\u2019s pretty much considered healthy to me). Anyway, back to trying to be healthy\u2026we\u2019re doing this for one reason\u2026because next week we\u2019re jumping into a deep fry fest of sorts to prep for the big game\u2026and lets be serious, game day is ALL about the food and booze!
p6394
aVAgain, these lettuce cups are great. Don\u2019t let the long list of ingredients intimidate you. This dish is actually very easy and doesn\u2019t take much time to throw together. We opted for butter lettuce, bc maybe there was an incident of me forcing Teri to help me in the kitchen by breaking apart a head of iceberg to make lettuce cups and maybe instead we ended up with a chopped salad of iceberg instead of the cups..\u2026just maybe :) You take your pick, both totally work great for this dish. Enjoy!

aVWe opted for butter lettuce, bc maybe there was an incident of me forcing Teri to help me in the kitchen by breaking apart a head of iceberg to make lettuce cups and maybe instead we ended up with a chopped salad of iceberg instead of the cups..\u2026just maybe :) You take your pick, both totally work great for this dish.

aVHi All! So it\u2019s starting to get really warm in LA, which makes me think of a few things: how I still haven\u2019t lost all of my \u201choliday weight\u201d (whoops), wishing my apartment had central air (\u201can ocean breeze\u201d just isn\u2019t the same) and last but not least\u2026.brunch! Not that brunch isn\u2019t awesome all year long, because it totally is, but I love warm weather brunch in particular\u2026that\u2019s all :) One of my favorite brunch dishes, that isn\u2019t necessary something you see everywhere or all the time, is chilaquiles. If you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s pretty much really tasty, soggy, baked chips\u2026yep, awesome.
p6503
aVThis is a super easy and basic version of a dish that has hundreds of variations. You can seriously add anything to it, corn, black beans, diced avocados, carne asada, diced chayote, ANYTHING! The key is really coating the chips in liquid and having a good balance between liquid and chip\u2026.you don\u2019t want the chips swimming in liquid even after they\u2019re out of the oven, but you also don\u2019t want to bite into a pile of dry, \u201cstale-like\u201d chips. It\u2019s a great dish to make for a group of people. This recipe makes a lot and it\u2019s pretty filling. Everyone should definitely make this dish for brunch this weekend; total crowd pleaser. Enjoy!

aVStrawberries and Cream. I grew up in Idaho, where my grandparents had a miniature farm on the outskirts of Boise. They had a little strawberry patch that I used to pick from. As a child, I remember being fascinated by the little berries growing from the plants. They were so tiny and cute, nothing like the large ones you find at the market. They were charming. My favorite way to eat them was chopped all up, sprinkled with sugar, and covered in a fatty milk. Strawberries and cream will always be one of the most delicious and simple things you can ever eat. Today, we have a take on my fond childhood memories.  A simple graham cracker crust, filled with sweet strawberries, and topped with a fluffy meringue, Strawberries & Cream. Yum.

VHi All! It\u2019s Friday\u2026yay! Well not really bc i\u2019m working tomorrow, BUT I\u2019m heading up to Carmel on Sunday for a few days with the bf and the pooch and I\u2019m so excited! We\u2019re staying at a bed n\u2019 breakfast that serves fresh cookies everyday (the part my bf is most excited about), which is super cute. We\u2019re driving and not flying this time to take advantage of the scenic/ocean view route up PCH, which I\u2019m only half excited about. Im sure the view will be great, but to me \u201croad trips\u201d usually mean lots of bathroom stops, unavoidable antsiness and constantly feeling like it\u2019s stuffy. There is a definite upside to this long drive though\u2026I\u2019m making kimbap for the ride!
p6648
aVKimbap is basically korean-style sushi rolls with really no fish involved. It\u2019s pretty much a marinated beef, veg and rice roll with many many variations. This is just my favorite kind to make. I love love love kimbap\u2026it\u2019s a great Korean snack that can really be eaten as a meal because it\u2019s so filling. If you don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of marinating meats and seasoning spinach etc just head to your local Korean market bc they usually have that stuff pre-marinated/seasoned for you, making this already easy recipe that much faster to put together! If you\u2019ve never had kimbap, I urge you to make this, it\u2019s really quite a tasty little snack/meal and you can just pop the pieces into your mouth\u2026OR you can be like me dad, not cut it into slices and eat the whole roll like a burrito\u2026yea, my dad\u2019s incredibly awesome like that :) Anyway, I hope everyone has a great weekend! Enjoy!

VHey All! So the weather in LA has been kind of funky lately. We keep getting a weird blend of chilly and warm weather. Seriously, one day I\u2019m out in a spring dress with sandals trying to get a tan while I run errands and the next I\u2019m bundled in a sweater, scarf and boots. It\u2019s weird and kind of annoying. Plus, it\u2019s making me get sick\u2026.or was it because I was up in Carmel this weekend, running around the beach in 50 degree weather without a jacket or close toed shoes\u2026hmm\u2026but I digress.
p6879
aVAnyway, I came back to chilly LA weather and now I have a stuffy nose, cough, blah blah blah\u2026 This really only means one thing\u2026.time for New England Clam Chowder. Yes! Not to mention, after having plenty of chowder up North the past few days, I\u2019ve realized that I have yet to make even a single batch of one of my all time favorite soups/chowders this year! This is my favorite way to make clam chowder. I cut out the usual celery and added some leeks and corn\u2026only because, well\u2026I love leeks and corn, that\u2019s all :). This is also quite a simple recipe\u2026not very much fuss beyond cutting up some veg! Enjoy!

p6922
aV5. While whisking, pour clam juice into the mixture in a steady stream until fully incorporated and no lumps remain. Lower the heat and allow the mixture to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture thickens (add ¼ to ½ more clam juice if the mixture becomes to thick while simmering)

VLets go over a few things I learned recently.
p6947
aV1. If you have an iphone 4S and change Siri\u2019s voice to UK, it sounds like you have Carson from Downton Abbey talking to you, pretty cool (Do you watch Downton Abbey? You really should, its awesome).
p6948
aV2. If you wear new dark denim jeans you have never washed, and them rub your hands on them, then look at your hands, you will think you are dying because your hands are blue. Good thing you\u2019re not, and its just the dye in the pants. Stupid.
p6949
aV3. You can\u2019t buy girl scout cookies online. Honestly, WTF.
p6950
aV4. When you have obese cats, and you put them on a diet, its a life ruiner (they won\u2019t stop complaining!).
p6951
aV5. Fried things in sandwiches is ALWAYS, yes ALWAYS a good idea, and no matter what, will ALWAYS be good. That is where todays recipe comes in. Oyster Po\u2019 Boys SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. I\u2019ve been wanting to eat one of these for a long time. Oysters have been a serious obsession ever since visiting Seattle. I can\u2019t get enough. So having them in sandwich form is pretty spectacular. I hope you will think so too.

aVGood morning! I\u2019ve been having a hard time getting out of bed. Mostly because its been raining. Do you ever wish that your morning was like exactly like the movie Cinderella (minus the mice helping) where you sing and birds help you get dressed for the day, and you\u2019re so totally pumped on life? I do. This dream is becoming slightly more of a reality because I have pigeons nesting by my bathroom window. Pigeons are really scary. Its really scary to be half awake and putting lotion on in the mirror and look over to see a bird staring at you. It unsettling, to say the least. I wish the pigeons were cute little birds that chirped instead of making that weird loud cat purr noise. But, they are not. I might start wearing ribbons in my hair so I can live part of my dream. I dunno. Also In my get pumped up morning dream, I have milkshakes for breakfast. In my dream milkshakes in the morning is like drinking OJ, good for you. So if you have a milkshake for breakfast, maybe try this one. Get pumped!

aVBreakfast is my favorite meal. I like to drink iced coffee and watch the cream climb its way down the chunky ice cubes in a dazy before the caffeine hits. I like to order bacon with whatever I\u2019m eating. I like eating potatoes with ketchup. I like eggs over easy, and fluffy scrambled eggs. I pretty much like everything there is to like about breakfast. That is why I am pretty excited about these Baked Egg Boats. They are sooo easy to make. Side note. Remember when Subway got all weird and cut a channel out of the middle of their sandwich bread, and then pulled the bread off cause they were trying to be all different? Yea, that was weird. I\u2019m pretty sure its refered to as the \u201cu\u201d cut with Subway sandwich aficionados. Anyway, if you remember that whole technique they used, apply it to this baked egg situation and I think it will work out pretty well.

aVHi All! I\u2019m just going to jump right into this recipe today, because I\u2019m super excited about it! Today we have cumin spiced, baked lotus chips. Yum! I love homemade baked chips\u2026.they\u2019re healthier, easy to make and fun to eat.  Lotus chips are a bit unusual, but SO tasty! I love lotus root; I love it thinly sliced and pickled, stir-fried, roasted, blanched and then tossed in a salad\u2026.I just really love the stuff and think it\u2019s a veg. that\u2019s totally underrated. These chips are so easy to make and you can flavor them how ever you like. I like the rich and savory flavors of cumin and curry, but I\u2019m sure an herb combo or even cinnamon-sugar spiced lotus chip would be pretty delicious. You can find these guys at most asian markets and some specialty markets. It\u2019s a great afternoon snack that\u2019s also super pretty, isn\u2019t it?! Anyway, make these\u2026seriously! :) xx Jenny

aVYou know what one of the worst feelings in the world is? When you leg falls asleep, and then you attempt to move it, and the feeling of all the blood rushes into your leg and it feels like a million baby needles are simultaneously pricking your skin. Its what I imagine the cruciatus curse in Harry Potter to feel like. This happened to me a restaurant recently, and I didn\u2019t realize it has happened until I got up and started walking. Once I started walking I found it rather difficult to move my leg, which then resulted in a most epic slow motion fall. I scraped my knee. It was embarrassing. I\u2019m glad its over.

I\u2019m not doing anything in particular, but I\u2019m excited to relax, ride my bike to the beach, take little Dex to the dog park, and to eat out at great places.

I\u2019ve been a little skeptical due to mixed yelp reviews (I\u2019m an avid yelper, yes), but the location is great  so one night the boyfriend and I finally tried it out. Okay, the atmosphere of this place was great, the beer selection and flights also great, the food was something to forget\u2026.EXCEPT for their Kimchi Cheesesteak. It was such a random item for this menu, but the kimchi-obsessed part of me was both curious and intrigued. Couldn\u2019t be more happy I made that decision because it was awesome! So simple. So good.

aVHi All! Today we have this flour-less amaretti cake for you. I really dig cakes like this for so many reasons; a few of them being: they\u2019re single layered (easy!), no frosting needed (super easy!), and the flour in this particular recipe is replaced with crushed [amaretti] cookies (awesome!). It\u2019s a quick cake to throw together, with only a handful of ingredients; it\u2019s chocolatey, decadent and SUPER

VHello! Something you all probably don\u2019t know about me is that long ago I was a vegetarian\u2026.FOR 3 YEARS! Crazy, right?! It was when I was in high school, after watching a rather inhuman and disturbing video in class. I swore off meat until one day, three years later, I walked into Panera Bread, bought and ate an asiago, roast beef sandwich and that was that :) Still to this very day I love my fair share of meatless dishes. Veggie burgers are always great and I\u2019ve tried them so many ways, with lentils, mushrooms, tofu, tempeh, etc. My favorite type of meatless burger is a good, full flavored black bean burger. We have one here for you all today, studded with corn (because corn is awesome) and loaded with spices. These burgers are great, but still rather soft and delicate and should be handled gently while cooking them. These are great with just about any topping and condiment of your choice, plus they\u2019re super easy to make and really fill you up. Enjoy!

VI just came back from Paris last week, and I\u2019m still trying to trick myself into thinking I can fit into my pants. Its times like these where yoga pants are really awesome. Basically, you walk around everywhere and there are windows on every block filled with delicious sugar taste explosions, colorful desserts that look more like art than food, and buttery crispy bread. How are people even skinny there? The one thing that I was particularly impressed with was all the crazy things they did with Éclairs. I think Paris\u2019s Éclairs are the equivalent to our obsession with cupcakes. They too come in all different colors, sizes, and decorations. It was insane. A quick trip to a local bookshop revealed this is true. There were books upon books about making the perfect pate a choux, different decoration ideas, and delicious ideas to stuff them with flavored fillings of all kinds. They were so pretty. So today we have a yummy raspberry Éclair recipe for you. I hope that you will try and explore some crazy and different decorations if you make these.

V1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
p7735
aV2. Place water, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
p7736
aV3. Add flour and stir with a wooden spoon 3 minutes or until a sticky dough forms. Pour dough into a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and beat for 2 minutes to release some steam. Add eggs one at a time, mixing and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.
p7737
aV4. Scoop dough into a piping bag fitted with a round tip (Ateco #806) and pipe 2 ½-3 inch long strips about 1 inch apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until éclairs have puffed and turned golden brown. Allow éclairs to cool slightly before carefully slicing in half. Place éclairs back onto the baking sheet and allow to dry out in a warm oven for about 15 minutes.
p7738
aV5. Place all pastry cream ingredients, except raspberry puree, vanilla and whipped cream, into a saucepan and whisk together. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently [to avoid curdling]. Simmer for 5 minutes or until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in raspberry puree and vanilla until fully incorporated.
p7739
aV6. Strain it through a fine sieve and place over an ice bath until completely cooled, stirring occasionally. [Tip: If the pastry cream is still lumpy after it\u2019s cooled, pass it through a fine sieve again and stir in 2 tablespoons of melted butter. This will remove the cooked yolk bits as well as give the pastry cream a smoother, glossier texture.]
p7740
aV7. Gently fold whipped cream into the pastry cream until fully incorporated.
p7741
aV8. Scoop pastry cream into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe pastry cream onto the bottom halves of the éclairs. Dip tops of éclairs in melted chocolate and shake to remove excess and top with quins. Place onto a parchment lined baking sheet and allow chocolate to set. Place tops over the whipped pastry cream and serve.

VHi there! So something weird happened to me the other day. I experienced one of those awkward middle school/high school, \u201csee someone you kind of know, but not that well or that you think is cute, hallway pass-bys\u201d. You know, the one where you see each other from complete ends of the hall and uncomfortably avoid eye contact until you\u2019re just about to pass one another, then make quick eye contact and nervously wave hello (even though you two are the only ones in the hall and have clearly spotted one another from the start) Only this time it was out by the pier near my apartment, it was an old culinary school acquaintance and after we did the first, \u201cOh hey, funny running into you here. How are you?\u2026\u201d, we did the uncomfy pass by THREE more times! Has this only happened to me?? Am I just that awkward??? hm\u2026\u2026. Moving right along\u2026..

It\u2019s a great, healthy vegetarian option, packed with protein, that you can serve guests at a weekend brunch or just make for yourself as a light, but filling meal. I hope you all make this simple and tasty dish this summer! xx, Jenny

V1. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil into a large heavy bottom skillet and place over medium high heat.
p7812
aV2. Add tofu and brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a mixing bowl and set aside.
p7813
aV3. Add an additional tablespoon of oil to the skillet and sauté onion, zucchini, yellow squash , and garlic for about 5 minutes or until onions have become slightly translucent and vegetables have softened. Season with salt and pepper. Pour mixture into bowl with tofu and set aside.
p7814
aV4. Pour remaining oil into skillet and sauté mushrooms for about 2 minutes. Add corn and continue to sauté for about 3 minutes. Pour tofu mixture back into skillet and stir. Add tomatoes and thyme and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust seasonings.
p7815
aV5. For the poached eggs: Crack each egg into its own ramekin and set aside. Fill a medium pot with about 4 inches of water; add vinegar and bring to a boil. Using a whisk, create a small whirlpool in the water and carefully add eggs, one at a time, into the center of the whirlpool. (it\u2019s best to do this in batches of 2) Cover and remove from heat. Allow eggs to poach for about 4 to 6 minutes before removing with a slotted spoon. Bring water back to a boil and repeat until all eggs have been poached.

We love the flavors of honey and lavender together; the subtle bursts of floral notes paired with sweet honey is really great\u2026we think so anyway. Plus there\u2019s booze in this granita\u2026not just any kind of booze\u2026\u2026.BUBBLY, the best kind! The pine nuts are sort of an extra addition. They\u2019re not totally needed, but adds a great spiced crunch to this granita and makes it a more \u201cfilling\u201d dessert. So if you have some time this weekend, make these Honey & Lavender Granitas!\u2026or not, but we totally hope you do!

p7886
aV3. After about 1 1/2 to 2 hours remove granita from freezer and gently scrape surface, with a fork, to break apart the formed ice crystals. Place back in the freezer and continue to remove from freezer and scrape every hour for 5 to 6 hours, until you have a baking dish of \u201cshaved\u201d/scraped ice.
p7887
aV4. For spiced pine nuts: Place nuts, oil, cinnamon, and coriander in a small bowl and toss together. Pour mixture into a small skillet and place over medium- low heat. Gently toast for 3 to 5 minutes, frequently stirring to prevent burning, or until lightly toasted. Pour mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment and spread in a single layer. Set aside and allow spiced nuts to cool completely.

aVHappy Friday! Yay! I am currently making Momofuku Ramen for 8 people to eat tonight. Pretty excited about it. This will be the first time I have had people over for a proper dinner. My friend Adrianna is making some delicious dessert from the Milk Bar cookbook. It\u2019s going to be so fun. It\u2019s so nice to finally have a dining room table so I can actually do these kinds of things. In preparation for eating massive amounts of ramen tonight, I did what most people don\u2019t do, I ate like 5 million burgers last night (when I say 5 million I mean 4 burgers split between three people). I am still so full right now. I only hope that I will be starving tonight so I can re pack my stomach with delicious pork and ramen.

aVWhen I\u2019m not stuffing my face with meat, I love to eat potatoes. Being an Idaho girl, I feel like I know my way around potatoes pretty well. Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite kinds. This Twice Baked Sweet Potato recipe is so perfect in its presentation. It makes a super tasty and super pretty side dish to nearly anything. If you want to go a little crazy, I think it would go awesome with a veggie burger. I hope you all will eat some good stuff this weekend!

I probably know more about the people I went to high school now than I did in high school. I get to see ultrasound images, and then pregnant monthly tummy growth pictures, pictures of people having a good times, posts about people when they are having bad times, posts about getting engaged, getting married, getting a divorce. It\u2019s like my own personal Us magazine. It\u2019s actually pretty neat, getting to see what people grew up to do with their lives. Pretty neat. You know what else is neat? Peonies, and the fact that they are in season. Love them. Although, the ones I have been getting smell a little funky. As the weather starts to warm, and people start wearing less clothes (no more scarves L) we like to throw some light-ish delicious lunch situations at you, one of them being this falafel pita sandwich. The tzatziki sauce is delicious, and the pita pockets fit these little falafel dudes perfectly. Eat up.

VHi all! One of my favorite things to do when I head into Chinatown (whether I\u2019m in LA or back in Chicago) is going out for some dim-sum. I love walking into, what seems like a giant conference room, with endless round tables, taking a seat wherever I can manage to squeeze in and watching the women with their carts of steaming goodness jump around from table to table, releasing giant pillows of steam into the air, each time they remove the lid on one of the containers on their cart (whoa, run on sentence much?). Ahhhh, it almost gives me a sense of calm\u2026.in a little bit of a weird and creepy way. ;)

aVHi All! Today we have Paella for you; our version of a classic family-style dish from Spain! It\u2019s filled with not just chicken and Spanish chorizo, but loads of shellfish too! Best of all, this entire dish is infused with saffron! I like to call this fragrant and perfume-like spice, \u201cculinary gold\u201d. It\u2019s super expensive, but well worth the price and you only need very little each time you use it. Fun fact: Saffron is so expensive because of the way it\u2019s cultivated. All the saffron in the world is HAND PICKED strain by strain\u2026yep, not an easy task. The first time I heard this little fact was years ago and that\u2019s also the same time I stopped complaining about the price \u2026aloud, at least. :)

VHi All! So by now I think you\u2019ve all noticed that we get a lot of our food inspiration from all around the world and we have a little thing for international cuisine. I think there\u2019s something so refreshing as well as fascinating about cultural gastronomy with no particular emphasis on \u201cfine foods\u201d. Growing up I was lucky enough to travel to a number of places around the world because my parents loved (and still do love) to travel; neither having been able to do much traveling themselves while growing up, made it a priority to take my sister and I to as many places possible so we could explore the world from an early age [just one of hundreds of reasons I will be forever grateful for my wonderful and inspiring parents].

aVHi guys! If you didn\u2019t notice we took ourselves a little break last week from the blog, and now we are back! WITH granola bars for you. Granola bars are one of my favorite things to make. They are so easy, and the flavor options are endless. They make the perfect snack, and they are even more perfect for summer. Its fun to think of bringing granola bars hiking (which I will NOT do until LA turns the heat down), or to a cute picnic (again, turn the heat down). This one is for all you people who go running early in the morning and post it on instagram, and make me feel like a blob because I am viewing that photo 4 hours after you posted it in bed. Snack away!

aVHi Guys! Today we have a bit of a treat for you all\u2026well, a totally different kind of treat than the one we had on Tuesday. We have a scallop and uni crudo for you today! I know this isn\u2019t for everyone, BUT for those of you who love this kind of stuff, (like me!) I wanted to show you how easy it is to make at home.
p8570
aVIt\u2019s always fun to make a \u201cfancy\u201d dish like this at home to impress your guests with, and it really does take no time at all. A couple tips for preparing this dish is to semi-freeze the scallops for about 30 minutes. This will make them much easier to thinly slice. Also, you want to very gently and carefully handle the uni and avoid handling it too much. I usually use a pair of chopsticks to pick them up as they \u201cbruise\u201d (get gross and gunky) easily. The same goes for the tobiko\u2026.handle with care! I went with the light colored tobiko (the one infused with yuzu) because I like the color of it. Feel free to go with the color of your choice. I like tobiko though over other roe, like salmon, bc they\u2019re really small/fine and I like the variety of colors they come in (black-squid ink, light orange-yuzu, green- wasabi). Finally, garnish with ingredients of your choice! I like using radishes and micro amaranth for the slight bitter taste (which is great with the fresh seafood and briny sauce) and the Serrano for heat, obvi. Feel free to go with the flavors and garnishes of your choice!  Give your crudo a light drizzle of olive oil before serving; the quality of oil is important here and sort of brings the whole dish together.
p8571
aVIn an upscale/fine dining establishment you can probably find this dish running anywhere from 12.95-16.95 (serves 1-2),  while you can probably make this dish at home for about the same price, but serve 5 to 6 people! What a great way to save money AND impress your guests, right?! We\u2019re in the thick of summer and dishes like this will keep you feeling refreshed and satisfied! Enjoy!

aVIt\u2019s always fun to make a \u201cfancy\u201d dish like this at home to impress your guests with, and it really does take no time at all.
p8612
aVA couple tips for preparing this dish is to semi-freeze the scallops for about 30 minutes.
p8613
aVAlso, you want to very gently and carefully handle the uni and avoid handling it too much.
p8614
aVI like using radishes and micro amaranth for the slight bitter taste (which is great with the fresh seafood and briny sauce) and the Serrano for heat, obvi.
p8615
aVGive your crudo a light drizzle of olive oil before serving; the quality of oil is important here and sort of brings the whole dish together.
p8616
aVIn an upscale/fine dining establishment you can probably find this dish running anywhere from 12.95-16.95 (serves 1-2),  while you can probably make this dish at home for about the same price, but serve 5 to 6 people!
p8617
aVWe\u2019re in the thick of summer and dishes like this will keep you feeling refreshed and satisfied!

aVHey Guys! Labor Day is right around the corner and that usually means quality time with family and friends, entertainment, lots of booze, and great food. This year for labor day we\u2019re going to be making these little guys\u2026okay maybe not so little, but seriously delicious, colorful and totally a crowd pleaser nonetheless. We used mahi-mahi for our tacos because it\u2019s a great grilling fish, but feel free to use any fish according to your taste! The creamy broccoli slaw adds an extra crunch compared to the usual cabbage slaw, and since we\u2019re using a nonfat Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and sour cream it\u2019s much better for you! The sweet and spicy mango salsa top these tacos off to create a wonderfully balanced fish taco! These tacos are not only delicious, but super easy to make! For the full recipe, check out our 
p8639
aV We hope everyone has a totally awesome sunburnt free, exciting and delicious Labor Day! :)

VHey All! So Last week I was in Wisconsin on a styling job, which was awesome!\u2026not just because the job itself was a lot of fun and I got to work with some super chill people, but also because going to Milwaukee means, driving down to Chicago after the job is done and spending a week with my parents! So here I am now, sitting in my parents home, relaxing and pretty much stuffing my face with all my mom AND dad\u2019s awesome, delicious, unreal, amazing home cooking (sure I\u2019m bias, but hey they really make some kick ass Korean food!) Yes, there are tons of amazing restaurants in Chicago that I miss dearly, but for some reason all I ever crave and seem to want to eat is my parent\u2019s home cooking. Is that weird? Do any of you feel like this? What are some of your favorite \u201cback at home\u201d meals you all crave? For me, it\u2019s usually my dad\u2019s bbqing (both Korean and non), my mom\u2019s amazing Korean soups and her incredibly mouthwatering \u201cbanchan\u201d (Korean side dishes). YUMMMM! Of course I do my fair share of cooking for my parents as well! They usually request certain things from me, like my loaded seafood gumbo, panzanella salad and potato, pesto gnocchi. When they don\u2019t have special requests I like to go to town and make them something I know they would never make themselves, but would love\u2026..enter Arepa Pizza.

V1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat a large cast iron skillet (or nonstick pan) over medium heat.
p8699
aV2. Make arepa dough according to the recipe. After dough has rested, form into a ball and place between plastic wrap. Using the bottom of a baking dish or large pan, gently and evenly press down on the wrapped ball until you\u2019ve formed somewhat of an 8-10 inch round that\u2019s about 1/8 inch thick.
p8700
aV3. Carefully peel the top layer of the plastic wrap from the arepa and flip into the hot skillet, then removing the bottom layer of plastic wrap. Cook arepa on each side for about 15 minutes.
p8701
aV4. While the arepa cooks, pour oil in a medium sauté pan and place over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté for 1 minute. Add chipotle and adobe to shallots and stir for an additional minute. Add chicken and fold together until fully incorporated. Finally, add the honey, gently stir together and remove from heat. Set aside.
p8702
aV5. For the cilantro sauce: Place all ingredients into a food processor pulse 6-8 times or until cilantro is finely minced and incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
p8703
aV6. Once the arepa has crisped and slightly browned on each side, remove from heat and spoon cilantro sauce over the surface. Sprinkle half the cheese over the sauce and top with chicken. Sprinkle remaining cheese over chicken and place in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes (you\u2019re just looking to melt the cheese).

It was totally educational and you could see the great deal of passion and intensity the owner has for his work\u2026.very cool! While at the GE Monogram facilities we split up into teams of four and had an Iron Chef competition where potato chips were the secret ingredient\u2026.and guess what?! We won with a rendition of our

VHey Guys! Yayayaya! It\u2019s finally a little chilly out in LA (again!)\u2026just let me do a quick Giuliana Rancic *happy dance*\u2026yay! I love chilly weather! I know I\u2019ve said this before, but I really do. To get myself even more into this amazing season I like to bake things that remind me of fall when I was a little girl\u2026.enter Apple Thyme Cake with a caramel sauce. :) It\u2019s my fun little play on the caramel apple!

p8897
aV; now this week thyme is back, but in a dessert! I love thyme, it\u2019s such a versatile little herb packed with tons of flavor. It\u2019s an herb that truly compliments so many different ingredients. The thyme is really subtle in this recipe, but adds a very lovely aromatic touch to the cake.
p8898
aVThe cake is great by itself, but the caramel sauce just sort of pushes it over the edge. If you fancy a salted caramel, like most of us do, feel free to add 2-3 teaspoons of sea salt to the sauce, before adding the cream. I thought a salted caramel sauce might be a little much for this cake, but to each their own! Oh and before I forget, use whatever apples you like to bake with; I chose to use golden delicious apples because they\u2019re one of my absolute favorites, plus their sweet and tart combo is really great for this cake! Oh and did I mention how easy this cake is? It\u2019s one of those all wet ingredients in one bowl and all dry ingredients in another, combine, mix and pour. I adore simple, but delicious baking recipes and this is definitely one of them! I hope eveyone has a great weekend\u2026.possibly making apple, thyme cake! :) xx, Jenny

aVHi all! Today we have a really yummy stuffing for you\u2026.and it\u2019s vegetarian friendly! My sister\u2019s a vegetarian (the kinds that still eats fish though, hooray sushi dinners!) and poor her because she\u2019s a part of a very carnivorous family. True story. Anyway, last year we posted a really tasty 
p9014
aV. I loved it so much that I used that stuffing last year for my family\u2019s thanksgiving get together (along with my mom\u2019s traditional stuffing she makes every year\u2026.which is so simple, yet so AMAZING). The sausage stuffing has become one of my absolute favorite stuffings! Sadly, my sister could only smell it and even more sad, stuffing\u2019s her favorite thanksgiving dish. So this year I\u2019ve decided not to be an inconsiderate a-hole and make a very vegetarian friendly stuffing that my big sis\u2019 can chow down on as well as the rest of us meat eating Parks!

aVHi Guys! How was your weekend? Did anyone watch the new Homeland? My only comment for the most recent show was Carrie, get the eff out of the bushes. Anyways its almost Thanksgiving, which means its almost Christmas. I am the overly enthusiastic person who looks for Christmas decorations in October. I get really excited when I see ornaments at rite aid. I just got a new aluminum Christmas tree on ebay I am really excited about. Yay. The other part of the holidays that I really really love is the baking, to be specific, the pies. I love making pretty pies. I take it fairly seriously, because I want my edible art to be really amazing. One of my favorite things to do with pies is adding meringue. Meringue is really easy to make, and it always makes for a really impressive display because of the height, and the beautiful natural ways it falls, which then gets accented by brulée-ing. Love. This is essentially a sweet potato pie, but more fun. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of pies you all make this year so please instagram them!

aVHi All! Did everyone have a lovely thanksgiving? Is everyone as full and hungover as I am? Does everyone have mad leftovers like I do? Is anyone wondering what to do with all of it?? Well if anyone made mashed sweet potatoes last night (or even regular mashed spuds) we have a great use for the leftovers. SWEET.POTATO.SPUDNUTS. For those of you who don\u2019t know what spudnuts are they\u2019re just the lightest, fluffiest doughnuts (made from mashed potatoes) that you\u2019ll ever experience!
p9163
aVCan we just take a quick step back and talk about how doughnuts/spudnuts are the best sweet treat ever? I\u2019m a total doughnut whore and I\u2019m okay with admitting it. I usually can\u2019t walk into a doughnut shop without HAVING to try at least 4 or 5 different kinds. I\u2019m not really a sweets person in general, but I will never, ever turn down a doughnut; they\u2019re just too freakin\u2019 good. Yum.
p9164
aVOkay, back to today\u2019s recipe. I know we\u2019ve posted a no yeast cake doughnut recipe a couple of times, both 
p9165
aV and 
p9166
aV, but today we\u2019re going for full on double rise, yeast filled spudnuts! These little guys are actually quite easy to make and the dough is so nice and pliable that it\u2019s easy to handle. The dough can be a little sticky (which is great for these purposes), so just make sure to flour your surfaces and hands well while working the dough. We\u2019ve coated our spudnuts in simple cinnamon-sugar mix, but feel free to glaze them if you prefer. If you\u2019ve never made or eaten spudnuts before, you\u2019re in for quite a treat! They\u2019re awesome.  I hope everyone had a great Turkey Day and if anyone is braving the Black Friday shopping madness\u2026.good luck and you\u2019re nuts! xx, Jenny

aV2. In a mixing bowl combine sugar and cinnamon until completely combined. Set aside.
p9204
aV3. In a small bowl combine both milk together and stir to create a luke warm milk. (doing this will prevent you from having to wait for your scalded milk to cool)
p9205
aV4. In a small bowl, combine the yeast and water and allow to sit for 5 minutes. (to activate the yeast).
p9206

p9208
aV7. Dump dough into a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but sticky dough forms, about 5 minutes. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
p9209
aV8. Punch the dough down and dump onto a lightly floured surface once again. Roll dough into a 1/2 inch thick slab.
p9210
aV9. Using a 3 inch circle cutter cut spudnuts from the slab and poke a hole in the center of each with your fingers (handle gently to ensure you don\u2019t deform your spudnuts) place onto a baking sheet with lightly greased parchment.

p9213
aV12. Drain spudnuts onto paper towels and while still warm, lightly brush each with melted butter on both sides, and toss in cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to three days.

aVMy new favorite thing is baked oatmeal. I have always been a huge fan of regular oatmeal, but I was always skeptical about baked oatmeal. I didn\u2019t want it to taste like I was eating a cookie for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I made it. The texture was great, and it saves in the refrigerator even better. It will definitely be one of those things I pre bake and heat up when needed. My favorite thing to do is to pour some soy milk over a huge scoop of it. We used cranberries and persimmons, but you can literally put anything in it. This year, I am trying not to eat 10 cheeseburgers every day, so if you are like me and trying to eat a bit more mindful, I urge you to try out this Persimmon & Cranberry Baked Oatmeal. Add the mix-ins you like, and maybe play around with things a bit. I have a batch in the fridge right now I am about to dig into. I hope you guys enjoy it. Happy New Year!

Lots of veggies, lots of salad, and lots of yummy juice. So today we wanted to share a different kind of salad with you. We have teamed up with Lilly Pulitzer and put a twist on her Pomegranate Pineapple Salad. This one is a breeze to prepare, and would make a really good lunch to take to work. The pomegranates give it a nice crunch, while the pineapple makes this salad feel refreshing.

aVHi guys! As you can probably tell Jenny and I are way into Christmas and love giving homemade gifts as presents. We already shared with you a cute wrapping situation for one of our banana bread recipes, and today we thought we would do homemade extracts. We are giving you recipes for five different kinds: lemon, grapefruit, vanilla, cinnamon, and orange. So you can either made all five, or pick you favorite and go with it. Extracts are really easy to make, the only thing you really need to give it is time, these extracts take about two weeks to make. This is a perfect recipe for you plan aheaders. In addition to these great extract recipes, we also have the 
p9512
aV ready for you to download, as well as instructions for the super cute wrapping. Lets get started! First, make your extracts:
p9513
aVNow, lets get started on the packaging.
p9514
aVHere are the supplies:
p9515
aV1. Extract bottles. We really 
p9516
aV! 8oz each.
p9517
aV2. Printable label sheets. 
p9518
aV3. 
p9519
aV4.
p9520
aV5. Medium (5×7) Craft Paper Bags. 
p9521
aV6. 
p9522
aVExtras: Glue gun, scissors and or an exacto
p9523
aVHere is how you do it:
p9524
aV1. Decant the extracts into the bottles. I like to do this first so there isn\u2019t any spillage on my freshly printed labels.
p9525
aV2. Print out the custom labels, and then cut them out. I used scissors for the ovals and an exacto and ruler for the Happy Holidays.
p9526
aV3. Label all of the bottles.
p9527
aV4. Cut some hemp twine. You can determine the length by wrapping some twine around the tops of the bottles and deciding how many times you want the twine to go around. After you cut the twine, tie knots at the end of each side and snip off the extra length. Then take your cute tinsle pom poms, squirt some hot glue on one, and then press the knot part of the twine into the hot glue. I used a food skewer to do this, but other long pockey things would work too. Repeat this until you have pom poms at both ends of the twine, and on all the twine you\u2019re going to need.
p9528
aV5. Take out the craft paper bags. I cut the tops off of them for two reasons. First, I didn\u2019t want the zig zag edge to be visible, and second, I wanted the bag to end at the bottle cap. I cut about an inch to an inch and a half off the bags. Then insert the bottles into the bags and twist the bags around until they fit tight. Fold the corners of the bag at the bottom under.
p9529
aV6. Take your twine, and wrap it around the neck of the bottle while trying to include the folds of the paper. Once you get down to the right amount of twine left over, tie it off.
p9530
aV7. Now you have your Happy Holiday printed bands out. Simply center the words on the front of the bottle and press firmly on the label in the middle. Then follow the label around to the back on the bottle pressing firmly one side at a time.
p9531
aV8. You\u2019re done! Go make people happy and give them this cute stuff you just made!

VHi Guys! Today we have somewhat of the \u201cultimate\u201d chili for you all today! I\u2019m calling it the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d chili because there\u2019s really just A LOT going on. Here\u2019s one of the awesome things about this chili, you can really adjust it according to preference. You don\u2019t want to go through the burden of roasting chiles? No problem. Use the chiles without roasting. Or if you just want to scale down on the different types of chili, go for it! Don\u2019t want to use short rib, but chuck instead? Sure! Too many types of beans? Just pick one or two and add more of them.
p9582
aVI\u2019ve also added some Mexican chocolate to mine because I\u2019m obsessed with mole poblano and would happily bathe in it all day. A real pool filled with mole, how fabulously disgusting, but I digress. This chili definitely has hints of mole from the chocolate, chiles and spices. If mole\u2019s not your thing, not a problem! Just scale down the amount or leave it out completely. Although I do love the depth of flavor the chocolate brings, your chili will still be delicious, trust. I recommend making this ahead of time, by about one day, and just reheating on the stove. It\u2019s such a yummy chili, but I do really think it\u2019s better the next day once everything has had a chance to sit and marry. Plus, making things ahead of time is so clutch for events like the Super Bowl. Who wants to be stuck in a sweating kitchen during the big 
p9583
aV food fest?!
p9584
aVHope you guys try this chili out for the super bowl, or pretty much any other time you get a chili craving going on! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVI guys! So we went a little MIA this past week working on some fun projects, but we\u2019re back with a bunch of fun and exciting things to share with all you lovelies! Today we have a roasted winter root veg. salad. I love salads like this; ones that can be considered a salad AND a side dish. I also love this salad bc you can eat it both warm and cold, so although it\u2019s a \u201cwinter\u201d root veg. salad, you can eat this even when it\u2019s warm out\u2026like LA these days, reaching around 75-80 degrees! \u201cAre you there winter?? It\u2019s me, Jenny\u201d. (<~ sorry, just had to)
p9708
aVThis dish is super filling, but won\u2019t leave you feeling heavy and gross\u2026my favorite kind of dish! The pine nuts add the much needed crunch and the feta a nice salty flavor. I like to shave the feta onto this salad because I like how it melts in your mouth right away, binding itself with all the other flavors going on. Plus, isn\u2019t the shaved feta just so pretty?! You can easily shave feta by partially freezing it for about 30 minutes, then use a peeler or mandoline to shave it atop the veggies. Simple! It\u2019ll help you avoid a crumbly mess (which actually isn\u2019t all that terrible, is it? :) ) Anyway, I hope you all try out our Winter Root Vegetable Salad and we\u2019ll be back with more fun treats this week! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

p9768
aV and eat good (bad for you) food. Yes, I am one of those lazy people that turn 50 and wonders where her 20 year old body is hiding under layers of fat. Things needed to change. I feel like in the past 2 years my metabolism has changed for the worse, my forehead wrinkles are more prominent, I have dark circles under my eyes, and my once clear face now has pimples (adult acne (can suck it) maybe?). It\u2019s frustrating. I am totally getting old. I have a birthday in a couple months, I don\u2019t even know if I am turning 28, or 29, or 30. I would have to do math to figure it out. After 25 it\u2019s all a blur. So I have been going to the gym, and going on hikes. Basically doing things that make my bottom hurt. I feel like when your butt hurts, you know your workout was a good one. Aside from hiking, eating better is another thing I\u2019ve been doing. It sucks. Salads suck. I\u2019m sorry, but they just do. For me to eat a salad, there has to be something to make it worth it. In this Grapefruit & Mixed Green Salad, it\u2019s the pistachio crusted goat cheese rounds. To be honest, I would probably not eat this salad if there were no goat cheese. To all the people who would eat this salad with no goat cheese, I wish I could be you.

VHey Guys! So, Valentine\u2019s Day is this week and I\u2019m already kind of over it. I mean enough already with the overtly sentimental jewelry commercials, the red and pink vomited aisles at drugstores and the rush to make dinner reservations at the most expensive and \u201cromantic\u201d restaurant you can think of\u2026.just stop it, please! Valentine\u2019s Day isn\u2019t supposed to be so complicated nor do I think it needs to be so\u2026.pink. It should be a time when couples take a little bit of time out of their busy schedules to tell each other, I like you and you make me happy\u2026AND for singles to re-recognize the fabulousness that is he or she and be happy about it. I don\u2019t think it needs to get any more complicated or cheesy. This year the boyfriend and I are going to cook a nice dinner together and watch movies\u2026.horror movies, that is\u2026why? because that\u2019s what we\u2019re into and that\u2019s what makes us happy! We\u2019re also headed back up to Idyllwild (one of our favorite quick weekend getaway spots!) for the weekend with pooch in tow, for a few days of hiking and (hopefully) snow! We rented a cabin up there back in December and had the best time ever\u2026plus, for a weekender the whole trip wasn\u2019t expensive at all\u2026.hint, hint to anyone in So Cal in need of weekend plans. ;) So this year, maybe don\u2019t stress yourselves out over buying expensive jewelry or going out to a place you can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t really want to go to; instead, just do something that you enjoy doing (whether you want to celebrate with a spouse or just some really great friends), that will make you smile and put you in a great mood\u2026.because why stress over a

aVToday we have a dessert that I like to think of as one of the most low maintenance, tastiest desserts ever. Simple Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta. Yum. Panna cotta is truly one of my all time favorite desserts (right up there next to doughnuts). Something about the oober soft and slightly sweetened cream, usually paired with a rich sauce/coulis, that I just can\u2019t resist. Not only is this dessert extremely versatile and delectable, but also really hard to screw up! There are no eggs involved, no chemical leavening agents to worry about, just a little gelatin to deal with, and once you\u2019ve bloomed the gelatin, the hard part (that\u2019s really no so hard) is over. I\u2019ve topped mine today with a mango-sage coulis because I wanted something reminiscent of warm weather (because it\u2019s been freeeeezing out!) and because I still wanted something slightly earthy and lemony\u2026.enter sage. If this coulis doesn\u2019t seem like the right one for you, you can also puree some raspberries with a little honey, sugar and lemon juice and you\u2019ve got yourself a simple and tart raspberry topper. If you want a quick and easy topping that will also set nicely atop the panna cotta, then you can just get your favorite store-bought preserve, warm it ever so slightly, place some over your set panna cotta and continue to refrigerate for another couple of hours. If you\u2019re looking for a super quick, low maintenance and delicious dessert to share with loved ones, I suggest you whip up a batch of this panna cotta\u2026so easy, so good! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

I love dates, their natural sweetness and how they lends themselves so well to baked goods, their ability to turn almond milk into a delicious milkshake like beverage and just being able to wrap some bacon around them and call it a day. Dates are awesome. Today we\u2019ve roasted them and tossed them into a salad. If you\u2019ve never roasted dates\u2026PLEASE.GO.DO.IT. They become these delicious candy-like things with a crisp exterior and wonderfully chewy interior (I\u2019m a major texture person, you all know this)\u2026.that combined with the thin, crispy prosciutto, pungent bleu cheese and crunchy almonds\u2026whoa, so good!

aVI used California dates in this salad over of the much prized Medjool dates because they are slightly less sweet and don\u2019t caramelize are quickly as Medjools would in the oven. They also have a firmer texture which aids them in the roasting process. You do need to be careful though and make sure to keep an eye on these things in the oven. Thy can burn fairly easily and even if they don\u2019t burn, if you pull them out a little \u201clate\u201d then you\u2019ll end up with rock hard dates instead of delicious crisp and chewy bites! If you want a heartier salad, feel free to use kale\u2026just as delicious! You can also swap the prosciutto out for crispy pancetta or bacon (although I would recommend speck, if anything), but I sort of like the oober, thin and crispy bit of prosciutto throughout the salad, which really helps to highlight the rest of the ingredients, rather than overwhelm them. You can also swap the bleu cheese out for goat cheese or a nice and salty ricotta salata as well as the toasted almonds for Marcona almonds (my favorite). This is a great salad to make for yourself or guests if you\u2019re craving something slightly different and slightly decadent. Enjoy!

aVSometimes you just want a huge pile of carbs and delicious meat. Sometimes you don\u2019t want to eat salads and steamed vegetables. Sometimes being bad (on your diet) is good. Sandwiches are one of my biggest vices. Carbs and meat together make a magical couple. I love tacos and burritos, but sometimes I want to sink my teeth into a fluffy cloud of bread instead of a tortilla. That is why I love tortas. If you guys are looking for a serious sandwich, I can say that this should be considered.

I hope this recipe inspires you all to make some crazy bread pudding concoctions. GO DO IT!

aVGuys, I love this recipe. This is one of those recipes we post on the blog and I think about it in the morning first thing because it could be my deserted island meal. First of all, hello corned beef. Hello CHUNKY corned beef. I love the chunks. It\u2019s a little different that what you would see normally, but I prefer it because things get crispier and I like that texture in my hash. I am the girl ordering well done fries at In and Out, and well done hash browns. Anyway, we benedict-ed this hash to make it even more amazing. Who doesn\u2019t like runny egg with delicious meat and potatoes? We made this to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day. We hope you can sneak this recipe in before you start to down green beer and then go on some crazy detox diet to get rid of the green dye in your body. Be careful out there!

V1. For hash: Pour oil into a skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add corned beef and sauté for 2 minutes. Add potatoes and continue to sauté for an additional 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add remaining hash ingredients and cook together for 7 to 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings and set aside.
p10251
aV2. For hollandaise sauce: Place egg yolks and lemon juice into a stainless steel or heatproof glass bowl and whisk together until the mixture doubles in volume. Place mixture over a pot with simmering water (make sure the water from the pot does not reach the bottom of your bowl) and begin whisking. While whisking, begin to add melted butter, in a slow and steady stream, until fully incorporated and the hollandaise is thick and smooth (the sauce should gradually thicken as you add the butter) Add cayenne and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and cover with plastic wrap, directly over the surface and set aside.
p10252
aV3. For poached eggs: Crack each egg into its own ramekin and set aside. Fill a medium pot with about 4 inches of water; add vinegar and bring to a boil. Using a whisk, create a small whirlpool in the water and carefully add eggs, one at a time, into the center of the whirlpool. (it\u2019s best to do this in batches of 2) Cover and remove from heat. Allow eggs to poach for about 4 to 6 minutes before removing with a slotted spoon. Bring water back to a boil and repeat until all eggs have been poached.
p10253
aV4. To assemble: Place an English muffin half onto a plate, cut-side up. Top with a heaping amount of hash followed by a poached egg. Finish with a generous drizzle of hollandaise (if hollandaise has thickened too much while sitting, just stir in chicken stock (1-3 tablespoons) until desired consistency has been reached) and a sprinkle of chives. Serve immediately.

aV Hi Guys! Did everyone have a good weekend? My boyfriend and I had a major cleaning fest this weekend. It was one of those things where we woke up one morning and just thought, \u2018This place needs to be spotless\u2019. You know, just one of those weird urges. So we did it. Not only did we clean, but we organized, dejunked, organized, dejunked, and organized. We finished each day with yummy cocktails, great home cooked meals (lots of 
p10281

p10282
aV involved!) and awesomely-bad movies. It was a great little weekend, indeed. :)
p10283
aVAnyway, since we worked so hard leaning this weekend we did treat ourselves to a little dessert out. We drove out to 
p10284
aV, a great British Pub in north Orange County. Their food is quite heavy, but delicious. Every meal comes with a side of mash and perfectly steamed peas and carrots, as they should. Okay, here\u2019s the thing\u2026.I usually don\u2019t go there for anything but one thing. Sticky.Toffee.Pudding. Their sticky toffee pudding is like unlike any I\u2019ve ever had. Ever\u2026..Even while in London (sorry!). I don\u2019t know how do describe it\u2026it\u2019s the perfect sweetness to creaminess to light sponginess to richness\u2026.ahhhh brain melt! I often talk about my lack of interest in desserts or sweet treats (with the exception of ANYTHING doughnuts), but I could seriously eat this pudding at any time of the day. Even if it were 100 degrees outside and I had just finished eating a thanksgiving feast\u2026..I would sit in the sun and eat this pudding.
p10285
aVSo today I\u2019ve made my humble, 
p10286
aV version of sticky toffee pudding. :) A little out of season? Who cares! It\u2019s so good! Even if you think you should or could skip out on the sweet cream, please don\u2019t! Although not a typical custard sauce, this simple sweetened cream, soaks into the cake so perfectly and adds almost a blanket of lightness around the super rich cake and toffee sauce. In need of a dessert to bring to a dinner party or school/work function? Make and bring this pudding\u2026.you\u2019ll be everyone\u2019s favorite person for the rest of the night\u2026for realz. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVHi Guys! Today we have quiche pockets for you! Think old school hot pockets, but breakfast-style, tasty, with a fun new shape! (I totally grew up on hot pockets, so I\u2019m really not one to judge) I like to think of this as the most portable way to eat quiche! I know there are the little quiche bites you can make in a mini muffin tin, but these are much more fun and much more conducive to dipping\u2026 oh yea, there\u2019s totally a cheesy dipping sauce for this. I mean why not, right?
p10373
aVYou\u2019ll all notice in the recipe that it says to create sort of a filling \u201cpaste,\u201d it might sound off, but it\u2019s very important the filling be thick and not runny at all because we\u2019re not \u201ccupping\u201d these into anything. It\u2019s best for the filling be thick so when you\u2019re forming your pockets things are easier to handle and you\u2019re not left with an eggy mess. Don\u2019t worry though because there will still be lots of yummy egg goodness in the pockets once they bake up.
p10374
aVI\u2019ve also had a few questions in the past each time I make a cheese sauce of sorts because I always toss my grated cheese into lemon juice. Why do I do this? Because tossing the cheese in a bit of acid will make it so your cheese sauce is nice and smooth and not stringy at all. I do hate a stringy sauce, so this is the perfect way to prevent it.
p10375
aVI\u2019m sure most of us will be brunching this Sunday, whether we celebrate Easter or not, and these are the perfect brunch-y like snacks to bring to whatever get together you may be going to. They also freeze and reheat well, so you could make a whole batch of these quiche pockets, freeze half of them and pop them out whenever you want a really eggy, yummy snack! Not into the alsacienne-like filling? Don\u2019t worry! Create whatever filling you want according to your taste, just remember the importance of the thick filling! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V1. For pie dough: Place flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk together. Add butter and cut into the dry ingredients using your fingers or a pastry knife until a fine mealy texture forms. Add water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing, until the dough just comes together. Form dough into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 30 minutes before using.
p10426
aV2. For filling: Place ham and onions into a small mixing bowl and toss together. Add eggs and milk and mix together. Fold in cheeses until fully incorporated. (you should have more of a loose paste texture, instead of a runny filling). Season with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to use.
p10427
aV3. To assemble: Preheat oven to 425°F. Roll chilled dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface. Roll until slightly thinner than 1/8 inch thick . Cut out 4 inch circles, using a circle cutter, and fill the center of each circle with 1-2 tablespoons of filling. Continue until all of the dough and filling have been used. (For egg wash: In a small mixing bowl beat together 1 egg and 2 tablespoon water.) Brush egg wash around the edge of each circle and fold together. Egg wash the sealed seam and starting from one edge push the seam over and squeeze the dough slightly. Use the dough you have squeezed and fold it over the seam again. Continue squeezing and folding until you have crimped the entire seam of the quiche pocket. Place pockets onto a baking sheet, lined with parchment, and pierce the top of each to allow steam to escape, while baking. Place pockets in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Brush the tops with remaining egg wash and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and the filling has set. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
p10428
aV4. For mornay sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle flour over surface and whisk together for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the milk and whisk together until no lumps remain and the mixture is thick enough to coast the back of a spoon. Toss cheeses in lemon juice and whisk into the béchamel sauce. Continue to whisk until no lumps remain. Season with salt and pepper and stir. Serve as a dipping sauce for quiche pockets.

aVToday we have a soup for you that more of you might know about than you think\u2026 Mulligatawny! If some of you are still scratching your head, lets just say it was popularized by 
p10465
aV guy, as one of his most prized soups (best episode ever, right?!). If you\u2019ve never had it before that needs to change! I\u2019ve had mulligatawny a number of times and each time I\u2019ve had it, it\u2019s been totally different.
p10466
aVThe first time I had it was in London, when I was in high school. A \u201cclassic\u201d version was set in front of me and I got a little sad. It looked like very watered down broth with bits of stewed onions, cabbage and black pepper sprinkled all around. When I tasted it though, the black pepper really stood out and the brothy soup ended up being pretty tasty when sopped up with warm, toasty crumpets. The next time I had it was back in the states. My family and I were trying out a new Indian restaurant that had opened up in our neighborhood. When I ordered the soup I didn\u2019t even realize it was the \u201csame\u201d as what I had gotten in London. This soup was thick, creamy and bright yellow. It was filled with earthy spices like cumin, paprika, cardamom and also had sweet notes to it, which I later found out was from a combination of sautéed apples and raisins. The soup was served with rice and topped with this delicious braised and shredded lamb. So flavorful, and unique!
p10467
aVThat night I discovered that there are hundred upon hundreds of versions of Mulligatawny, each different and special in its own way. I love that. So today we have our own version of one of my favorite soups! I went with the pureed creamy version because pureed and creamy is delicious and you still get nice texture from the rice, chicken, cilantro, and raisins. Don\u2019t let the laundry list of ingredients intimidate you, this soup is actually very easy to throw together and everything goes into one pot, which is great and makes for an easy clean up! This soup also stores and reheats very well. Great for anytime of the day year round. This is my go to soup when I want something a little different, filling and absolutely delicious! xx, Jenny

aVHey Guys! Today we have uni risotto\u2026plus I originally had a great story about my trip to Mexico last week and about how I ate really fresh uni, then became super inspired to make a simple uni risotto dish\u2026.but then Instagram threw me for a loop and I haven\u2019t been able to get it off my mind, so here it goes: Kids on Instagram should be a major no no. Or if they\u2019re going to be on instagram, maybe put some sort of regulation on their accounts? (I\u2019m saying like 12-13 yrs old and under) Am I the only one with a strong opinion about this? Do I sound like an old lady??
p10578
aVHere\u2019s why I had this sudden freak out about Kids on Instagram: I was doing my daily \u201cprocrastination by insty\u201d the other day, scrolling from photo to photo and stumbled upon a very rude and crude comment made by someone, about a cake that someone else had posted. I was annoyed right then thinking to myself, \u201cWho does that, seriously? So rude, so stupid.\u201d Anyway, that took me to clicking on the rude commentator\u2019s profile to see why he thought he was so great as to be able to leave nasty comments on another person\u2019s photo. What I saw shocked me\u2026. It was a little, pre-pubecent boy! On top of this, his profile was public, he had posted his phone number on his profile and there were a bunch of \u201cselfies\u201d of him standing in front of the mirror, shirtless\u2026.with really \u201cgrown up\u201d captions!! Whaa???
p10579
aVOkay, so I\u2019m not a mom (except to my precious dog, Dexter) yet, but please, current moms out there (or anyone else out there for that matter), is this normal? okay?? is it safe?? Am I just being crazy about this?? I just feel like there\u2019s something so unsafe and slightly creepy about what looks to be a 9 yr old on instragram posting crude things, topless photos and publicly announcing his home/cell number?
p10580
aVI don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something that makes me so uncomfy about the whole thing! Maybe I\u2019ve watched too many episode of Law and Order, but man was I creeped out. Thoughts? Anyway, I guess I\u2019ll just go back to noshing on this giant bowl of uni risotto because when I\u2019m feeling weird or creeped out (like right this very second!) a bowl of this rich, creamy and briny risotto or any risotto for that matter (like 
p10581

VWhen I was a kid, I wasn\u2019t allowed to have sugary cereal. My Dad would say we could have whatever had less than 12 grams of sugar per serving or something like that. So you go into the store, and start looking at the sugar serving, and realize all the good stuff is way above that mark. I was crushed. I remember seeing these commercials for this mini cinnamon roll cereal and as a child, my mind was totally blown. How did they make cinnamon rolls so small? Do people with really tiny hands bake them? Where do they come from? Is this what magic is? Come to find out at the store, this cereal was like only made of sugar. I was so sad. No mini cinnamon rolls for me. This is why I am so excited for this recipe. These are my mini cinnamon rolls from my childhood, only these are made with pie dough. It\u2019s pretty neat actually, because we are just not entering pie season, so you can make these cute little wheels with your left over pie trimmings. We paired our Cinnamon Sugar Pastry Wheels with vanilla frosting and our rhubarb raspberry cardamom jam, but you can dip them in almost anything and it will be delicious.

aVHey Guys! Today it\u2019s all about roots\u2026and chips. I love root vegetables in all forms. Mashed, roasted, grilled, braised, pureed, fried, glazed. There\u2019s really so much you can do with them. Today we have a triad of root chips! I\u2019ve always had a thing for Terra brand chips and love the root veg. concept of them. So flavorful, so yum. Today we have a combo of purple sweet potatoes, yucca and red beets! I love the sweetness of these veggies together with a good sprinkling of kosher or sea salt. So good! The colors are also super pretty together. The photos above are of the deep fried version, but we\u2019ve also provided you with baking instructions and shallow pan fry directions because we know that everyone likes to deal with homemade chip making differently. :) My preferred methods are the deep and shallow fry because they just really produce better, consistent chips, but the baking works as a good, healthier alternative. One thing to note is that while you want to get the slices pretty thin, you don\u2019t want to go paper thin bc you\u2019ll end up with shriveled burned things with no body\u2026no buéno. Anyway, enjoy! xx, Jenny

VHi Guys! Last week Teri and I flew out to Las Vegas to attend The Best Food Blogs event thrown by Saveur Magazine. It was amazing. They really wined and dined us and took us around to a number of restaurants/venues at the Bellagio (where everything was being hosted). Huge thanks to both Saveur and Bellagio for hosting us last week! Our evening began with sot an Asian inspired theme at two of the restaurants, Sensai and Jasmine. The tasting menu\u2019s were incredible and it takes me to today\u2019s recipe.

aVWe have a simple honey-soy braised rib dish that is absolutely mouthwatering and delicious. It\u2019s a pretty self-explanatory recipe with the exception of the boiling the meat might seem strange. My mom has always told me to boil pork ribs (with some ginger) before proceeding on to draw out some of the fat as well as remove some of the off-putting \u201cpork smell\u201d. Please don\u2019t skip this step as it\u2019ll help to not turn the final sauce into one big greasy mess, plus you\u2019ll have a lot less skimming to do.
p10756
aVThis dish is great for any occasion, but I really like to serve it family style to a close group of friends. This recipe feeds a pretty large group so it\u2019s perfect for casual get togethers. I love to serve it over rice, but quinoa is also a great substitute if you prefer that. Enjoy!

VHi Guys! Hope everyone had a great weekend! I was working on a big job Friday and Saturday so I pretty much crashed on the couch all day yesterday doing some writing, with 30 Rock on in the background, awaiting Game of Thrones. I\u2019d say all in all, yesterday was a successful lazy day\u2026.equipped with In n Out and gummy bears. Great lil\u2019 day, indeed! Did anyone do any fun cooking? I really didn\u2019t have time, but this weekend I\u2019m making this Cochinita Pibil dish again! It\u2019s pretty much a Yucatan-Style slow roasted pork dish, marinated in achiote and citrus juices and slow roasted in banana leaves. It\u2019s such a tasty dish! It\u2019s actually one of my guy\u2019s favorite things to eat and he gets it at least twice whenever we\u2019re in Mexico. Don\u2019t let the laundry list of ingredients intimidate you! This is a rather easy recipe to make and if you\u2019re feeling less than enthused about the spice mixture, go ahead and play around with your own flavors (the achiote paste or annatto seeds and citrus juice are a must\u2026other than that, do you!) You\u2019re really just letting the meat marinate before throwing it into the oven for hours\u2026easy!
p10827
aVThis particular pibil you see in the photos above is actually wild boar. I only used this because I was lucky enough to score some fresh wild boar meat from one of the cooks from Bestia, Erik Sun (p.s. if you live in LA and haven\u2019t been yet\u2026it\u2019s a MUST\u2026their pastas and pizzas\u2026I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E.). When people say \u201cfood\u201d people are some of the nicest, most generous people. I totally agree, and here\u2019s why. I actually met Erik through an old friend\u2019s brother. I haven\u2019t spoken to my friend in yrs., just little texts and facebook posts here and there. Her brother actually reached out to me via instagram saying that his friend is heavily into food, like me, and I should meet him. Not in a weird/creepy type of way, but more in a \u201cyou guys could probably pick each other\u2019s food-centric brains for hours\u201d type of way. Long story short, I discovered this guy doesn\u2019t only work in restaurants, but he is also a great wild boar hunter, deep sea fisherman, sea urchin spear fisherman, etc. Whoa. My mind was blown. The most awesome part of Erik\u2019s passion for obtaining the freshest food available; he\u2019s a firm believer in using as much of his \u201ckills\u201d as possible and leaving little to no waste. It\u2019s really not a \u201cjust for sport\u201d thing for him (which I\u2019m really not into\u2026because I think it\u2019s sad). He respects the animals and that\u2019s super important! It was really incredible and inspiring to meet Erik (Pursuit of Food is his instagram account\u2026go check it out!!!) You\u2019re probably wondering why this weird rant came about, because clearly I went on a tangent. The point of this story was that he had an abundance of freshly hunted wild boar a couple months back and was looking to give it away. I told him I wanted it and the next thing I know I\u2019m meeting a generous stranger at the restaurant he works at so he could give me pounds upon pounds of wild boar meat. Pretty awesome, if you ask me!
p10828
aVI brought my almost 30 pounds of meat home and started to break it down, ribs and all. The boyfriend and I were pretty much eating wild boar for weeks. (no complaints here) I think if I use wild boar for this dish again I won\u2019t trim the fat as much as I would regular pork. The meat is much more lean and my results were slightly dry. I\u2019ve since made it again with pork with nice, moist shredded results. I love turning dishes like this into tacos, but you totally don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve added instructions for my quick pickled red onions and super simple cilantro crèma. It\u2019s a great dish to make for a crowd. You can set up a taco bar with fixin\u2019 and let people go to town. Taco bars are the best. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VI always love recipes that utilize the outcast part of an ingredient. When you realize you can make something delicious out of something you thought was useless it\u2019s like discovering a whole new ingredient. I was first experienced this when I discovered carrot top pesto. It was kind of mind blowing for me, and exciting to tell the grocery store cashier not to remove the tops (it\u2019s the little things). That is how I feel about this recipe. I never really thought of using these parts when I buy beets. As you can imagine the stems and leaves are slightly bitter, but don\u2019t let that deter you. It\u2019s really good, and we added citrus and champagne vinegar to balance out the taste. The result is a refreshing dish that is a really perfect side for almost anything. Hope you guys like it!

VHi Guys! It\u2019s really beginning to feel like summer in LA. I have mixed feelings about this. I love the idea of summer. I love the beach, bbq\u2019s, going to a park to play bocce-ball, shaved ice\u2026.I love all that stuff. Things I\u2019m not such a fan of: the heat, mosquitos, the heat, loads of \u201csummer\u201d kids everywhere (yep, I said it), the heat\u2026.do you see a pattern here? I wish I could have an amazing attitude about it, but man\u2026nothing\u2019s worse than sitting and doing absolutely nothing and sweating profusely\u2026just because of the weather\u2026and then having to peel yourself off a leather couch?\u2026UGH. Can you tell I\u2019m a little stressed about the heat? I would love to have a positive attitude about it, but I\u2019m a\u0336 \u0336b\u0336r\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 scared.
p11023
aVI think I was scarred the first year I lived in LA County, in Pasadena. It was so devastatingly hot and the wall a/c unit wasn\u2019t doing the trick, so my boyfriend and I often found ourselves perusing the CVS up the block, for HOURS, just to take advantage of their central air\u2026it was a sad time.
p11024
aVIn a bit of irony, here\u2019s a stir-fried bitter melon dish for you all today! :) Okay, this one isn\u2019t so bad because although it uses high heat, it cooks up fast. Also, I always try to start the summer off with a healthy food kick (that usually lasts for about 3 days) and this year I\u2019m doing it by cooking up a bunch of different veg. in a number of ways. I had always seen bitter melon at the market, but had never tried it. I assumed it would be bitter (duh, right?), but I didn\u2019t realize just how bitter\u2026.My mistake for taking it home and trying to eat it like a raw cucumber. The second I took a bite it felt as if my cheeks were being sucked into my brain and my mouth immediately dried out.
p11025
aVOne and a half days later I braved bitter melon again. I decided to stir fry it to remove some of the bitter taste (that was pretty much my only goal at that point). I used a combination of oyster sauce, fish sauce and sugar to draw out the bitter and to impart other flavors to it. Success. The results were a still bitter, but a much more mellow tasting dish that was actually pleasant and developed the texture of a cooked summer squash, soft and juicy. Now I know fish sauce is really scary for some people (I can drink the stuff from the bottle, while the boyfriend gets one whiff and wants to vom then pass out), but thats okay! You can omit the oyster sauce and fish sauce and replace it with a red wine or sherry vinegar. You\u2019ll get the same bitterness cutting effect without the fishy flavor. It\u2019s really nice to have this dish with something slightly fatty like crispy pork belly because they balance each other nicely.
p11026
aVIf you\u2019re feeling bold or bored\u2026or just trying to avoid the heat outside go peruse your local market and pick up that weird veg. that reminds you of an alien and try it out! It a scary veg. can be turned into something quite lovely! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VDo you remember some of your early culinary adventures as a kid? Where you would find something out and then it would forever stick with you and you wondered why you hadn\u2019t thought of doing it before? For me, those kinds of discoveries were any kind of chip in any kind of sandwich, cereal in ice cream, French fries in chocolate milk shakes, and vegetable cream cheese on a blueberry bagel (still eat this ALL THE TIME). As an older child I discovered putting fritos in the bottom of your bowl of chili. Whoa. I still think about it every time I want to make chili. If you don\u2019t have fritos, my second thought is always layering corn bread at the bottom of the bowl. It becomes what I would later term as the \u201cgrape-nuts effect\u201d (basically it soaks up all the good stuff and at the end you\u2019re eating a soggy delicious mess).  I would describe the pay off to be similar to lucky charms milk. Always having been a huge fan of corn bread, I am excited about this recipe for Buttermilk Cornbread and Bacon Lime Chili Butter. So the deal with this Buttermilk Cornbread is that it isn\u2019t too sweet, so you can totally use honey on top if you like that kind of thing. There are corn chunks in it so you still have some nice texture. The butter is on a whole other level. If you prefer to eat your cornbread alone (not at the bottom of your chili bowl), then you MUST make this butter. It\u2019s like a smoky bacon dream spread. In fact, I would recommend doubling this recipe and eating it on toast in the morning. It really is that good.

VHi Guys! Lets talk steaks! I\u2019m not a huge steak eater\u2026well, that\u2019s not entirely true. I do love me a deliciously cooked steak. Medium-rare for me please. I just don\u2019t eat big ol\u2019 steaks that often. I buy them here and there, yet usually slice them up for sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. Every now and then I crave a big chunk of meat and little to nothing else. That\u2019s when I usually go to Whole Foods or my local butcher and buy a couple nicer steaks and grill them up. For the most part I\u2019m a steak purest (is that the right word?). I like nothing on my steak but a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. On occasion I get a hankering for an awesome demi-glace or even a whole grain mustard cream sauce to pour all over my meat, but this last time I wanted something a little more. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s so much amazing produce in season right now, but cherries are where my head went\u2026and you guys, I\u2019m in love. This cherry compote is so good! The first time I made it I ended up only eating a little bit with my steak because I was too busy shoveling it into my mouth straight from the pan. It provided just enough of the sweet-tartness that I was looking for and the pistachios are like I texture paradise.
p11198
aVI think I\u2019m most excited about the cherry-port compote as I\u2019ve already decided it\u2019s great on practically everything, both sweet and savory. I\u2019ve topped my pork chops with it\u2026yum, some toast for a mid-afternoon pick me up\u2026.totally hit the spot, and my homemade vanilla bean and brown sugar ice cream\u2026.this combo actually gave me a meltdown it was so good.

V1. 30 minutes before grilling, remove the steaks from refrigerator and let sit, covered, at room temperature.
p11230
aV2. Heat grill to high. Brush steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place steaks on the grill and cook until slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip steaks and continue to grill 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare (internal temp. of 135°F), 5 to 6 minutes for medium (140°F) or 8 to 9 minutes for medium-well (150°F). Transfer steaks to a cutting board tent loosely with foil and allow steaks to rest 10 minutes before slicing.
p11231
aV3. While the steaks rest, make the compote: Pour oil into a skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add cherries and thyme sprigs and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Deglaze the pan with vinegar and continue to cook until all liquid disappears, about 2 minutes. Add port and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until most of the liquid (about 2/3\u2019s) has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and stir in 1/2 the pistachios.

I love the way the meat feels on my teeth as I scape it off. If you\u2019re lucky, you get a piece with a bit of charr to it. I love the subtle hints of the spices we used.

With the motor running begin adding oil, in tiny, slow drips, waiting for the mixture to emulsify before adding more. Continue until all oil has been use and mixture is thick. Add roasted garlic and pulse until desired consistency has been achieved. Season with salt and pepper.

VHi guys! Yesterday we shared our recipe for Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce. I really love making my own condiments, it\u2019s always pretty easy and for some reason I end up feeling more accomplished than when I cook a whole meal. Anyway, while I love all kinds of barbecue sauce (I\u2019m totally a sauce person\u2026the more sauce the better for me) I love a nice, sweet and thick barbecue sauce for poultry. I like the flavor it gives and the char you get from the sugar hitting the heat.
p11423
aVAnyway, I thought this would be a fun recipe to tackle because I\u2019ve never seen BBQ Turkey Drumsticks being served anywhere other than theme parks and county fairs. Am I right? Has anyone seen these things anywhere else? I don\u2019t really frequent either of the above, but when the boyfriend and I do happen to find ourselves around a BBQ Turkey Drumstick vendor we must have one\u2026.that and buttery corn on the cob. Those two food items are a must. So today we\u2019re using our sweet and tangy barbecue sauce recipe to slather onto lightly brined and slow grilled turkey drumsticks. You can usually find turkey drumsticks year round at markets such as Whole Foods, meat markets/butchers; this includes (pre-cooked) smoked meat that is great if you want to skip the brine and long cook time. You can throw them onto the grill until heated through before brushing with sauce.
p11424
aVIf you\u2019re looking for a little something different and delicious to grill this summer season, maybe think about adding these bbq turkey drumsticks to your menu. You can even make a meal of it by pairing it with a few of our quick and easy side dishes:

I always feel like I am a good clean organized person when I label stuff.
p11499
aVOk back to the BBQ sauce. We have a really neat recipe coming up that uses this Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce, so look our for it. Or, you could just eat it with tater tots like I did (Tater tots are so much better than french fries, I wish more restaurants had them). This sauce has bacon in it, because we love bacon and why not? This is a chunkier BBQ sauce, but you can totally adjust the purée to the way you like it. Don\u2019t be intimidated by all the ingredients either, they all just go into the pot and simmer for awhile and then you get this bomb sauce! Hope you guys enjoy!

VHi Guys! I\u2019m very excited because today we have our first ice cream of the year\u2026and it\u2019s actually frozen custard! Difference between ice cream and custard? The yolk content in frozen custard is much higher, resulting in a much richer product. Yum. Today we\u2019re starting with Crème Brûlée Frozen Custard, a deliciously velvety and creamy custard with a deep vanilla bean flavor. This frozen custard is so nice and thick  that you\u2019re safe to brûlée the tops for a few seconds without turning everything into a creamy puddle. I absolutely love this dessert, especially since it doesn\u2019t skip out on the best part of crème brûlée, the caramelized sugar shell. Since there are so many yolks used in this custard it\u2019s important to make sure you keep your heat pretty low as you scald your mixture to ensure you don\u2019t scramble your eggs. Although you strain the mixture you\u2019ll be left with a faint taste of cooked egg\u2026.no thank you, not for me. Anyway, we could all use some frozen treats this summer and this one\u2019s pretty awesome, me thinks. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVDid you guys have ice cream trucks go down your street when you were a kid?  I still have ice cream trucks go down my street and to be honest, it\u2019s really kind of annoying. Mostly because there must be two or three competing trucks that drive this area, so we have one coming down our street three times a day driving really slowly playing that song. Anyway, we decided to re-create an ice cream truck staple today: Real Fruit Bomb Pops. If you have never made popsicles before I strongly suggest buying some 
p11627
aV 
p11628
aV and get to it. It\u2019s so easy and fun, and you can use all the awesome berries that are just coming into season. For our Bomb Pops we kept our layers simple, making them one flavor per layer. We have strawberry, blueberry, and lemon.
p11629
aVPro Tip: It\u2019s best to limit the different fruit and ingredients you puree together when making popsicles. My boyfriend likes to make smoothies, and has a knack for making them look like vomit and other things. So I just want you to be aware of that when you get crazy with your Popsicle making.

VToday we have two super simple recipes for homemade ice cream cones! I love a good waffle and sugar cone, but it\u2019s hardly difficult to make at home. If I\u2019m feeling particularly lazy, I\u2019ll put the freshly baked/pressed discs into cupcake tin holes to make ice cream cone bowls. A few things to know about making your own ice cream cones, for the waffle cone recipe you\u2019ll need a waffle cone maker\u2026if you don\u2019t have one no worries, you can make the sugar cone recipe which is super tasty!
p11704
aVFor the sugar cones, I\u2019ve created a stovetop version. You can totally bake these if you\u2019re more familiar and comfortable with that method (350°F for 5 to 7 minutes), but I have found that the cones cook more evenly and stiffen better when cooked on stovetop. I\u2019m not going to lie, although the recipe and method is easy, you need a bit of patience to make your own ice cream cones as you need to make them one by one because they harden super fast. The towel you lay the hot discs onto is super important as you\u2019ll burn you hand pretty bad if you don\u2019t use it to help you roll the cones. One last important tidbit of information is that it\u2019s important for the skillet to be cooled each time you add the sticky batter to allow it to spread easily and evenly. Oh! I Lied! There\u2019s one last super important thing about making your own cones, dipping them in chocolate after they cool. This will totally help prevent major drippage once your ice cream begins to melt.
p11705
aVIf you\u2019re feeling a little adventurous and up for the task I recommend making these homemade ice cream cones. They\u2019re really delicious and you\u2019ll feel completely accomplished after you do! Xx, Jenny

V1. Stovetop sugar cones: Place egg whites, sugar, milk, vanilla, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Stir in flour and butter until fully incorporated and batter is smooth. Lightly spray a nonstick skillet with a small amount of cooking spray. Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons batter into the cold skillet and spread into a thin even layer. Place skillet over medium heat and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until base has set. Flip and continue to cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Quickly lay sugar disc onto a clean towel and top with cone roller. Using towel and cone roller, roll sugar disc into a cone shape and hold, seam side down for 1 to 2 minutes or until cone cools and hardens. (this must be done quickly as the disc will begin to harden almost immediately after leaving the skillet) Cool skillet and repeat until all batter has been used. Cool cones completely before dipping the tips in chocolate and setting on parchment until the chocolate hardens. Carefully store in an airtight container for up to three days.

aV2. Waffle cones: Pour all ingredients into a mixing bowl and whisk together until no lumps remain. Allow mixture to sit for 5 minutes. Heat waffle cone maker to desired settings.

VI feel like most adults eat ice cream the same way, huddled in front of the freezer with your spoon eating out of the carton. I don\u2019t blame you, I do it too. After making dinner and cleaning up the last thing I want to do is dirty another dish. I remember being a kid and being so freaking excited out of my mind to go get ice cream. I think it\u2019s probably safe to say that as we get older, we skip out on desserts a lot more. So I think it\u2019s time to make some crazy banana splits and be really freaking excited about it. I love this recipe because of the grilled bananas. It\u2019s really that simple, just adding some grilled bananas to the situation will enhance it so much. Here is why: Regular freshly peeled bananas are just find and delicious, but firm-ish, unless they ugly and have brown spots. By grilling these they get soft like the ice cream which just makes it that much more pleasurable to eat in my opinion. We added some caramel sauce and nuts just cause. I hope this inspires you all to create some new ice cream situations. You deserve it!

V The thing that about picnics is making sure you have chosen the food you\u2019re going to eat correctly. You don\u2019t want stuff that will be gross cold, or be totally soggy, and or be hard to eat. It\u2019s kind of a hard choice. You also have to make sure you bring all the necessary accessories. It sucks so bad if you go and forget to bring napkins. Huge bummer. I am excited because today we have a really good picnic sandwich. It\u2019s a family style Fried Chicken Sandwich. We used Challah bread, which I think works out really well because it\u2019s denser bread, and won\u2019t get all nasty and soggy. I would pair this sandwich with some crispy kettle chips. You get those two and you have an amazing picnic on your hands.

VHi Guys! We\u2019re ending our week with sweet corn ice cream, but don\u2019t worry because we\u2019re not done with frozen treats quite yet. We still have some pretty awesome things on the horizon so stay tuned! Anyway, I had sweet corn ice cream for the first time about 12 years ago in Italy. I was on a Europe trip with my family and my dad and I were pretty much hitting up all the gelato shops we passed\u2026.we called it \u201cgelato hopping\u201d because we\u2019re gluttonous-nerds. While I don\u2019t have a huge sweet tooth, when it comes to gelato in Italy (and doughnuts of course) all bets are off. I probably gained 10 pounds on gelato alone that trip. :)
p11876
aVAnyway, I loved that all the shops had such amazing flavors that were so new to me at the time: honey-lavender, caramelized white chocolate, roasted pineapple and coconut cream, etc. My favorite by far was the sweet corn flavor. I love corn, but thought eating it in gelato form would be kind of weird. I was dead wrong. It was one of the most delicious things I ate that entire trip (and we traveled to 12 different countries, so I feel like that\u2019s saying a lot!).  The sweet corn was totally dominating the light vanilla flavor and it was awesome.  One particular shop we went into was stuffing their gelato into sweet rolls so of course we were curious and had to try it out. This immediately became my favorite way to eat gelato/ice cream/custard\u2026sorry cones, you guys are now a close second.  What I love about eating it this way is that the rolls themselves are light and slightly sweet so it\u2019s still mainly about the ice cream. The best part though is that the melty ice cream gets sopped up by the bun creating sort of this semi-soggy and oober delicious ice cream burger\u2026messy but so freakin\u2019 good!
p11877
aVAs we start to get into the warmest time of the summer I think stocking up on frozen treats is a must. My freezer is currently stocked with homemade ice cream and frozen custard\u2026.well that and Otter Pops, because I mean c\u2019mon, Otter Pops are awesome.  Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVAnyway, I had sweet corn ice cream for the first time about 12 years ago in Italy.
p11915
aVAnyway, I loved that all the shops had such amazing flavors that were so new to me at the time: honey-lavender, caramelized white chocolate, roasted pineapple and coconut cream, etc.
p11916
aVWhat I love about eating it this way is that the rolls themselves are light and slightly sweet so it\u2019s still mainly about the ice cream.
p11917
aVThe best part though is that the melty ice cream gets sopped up by the bun creating sort of this semi-soggy and oober delicious ice cream burger\u2026messy but so freakin\u2019 good!
p11918
aVMy freezer is currently stocked with homemade ice cream and frozen custard\u2026.well that and Otter Pops, because I mean c\u2019mon, Otter Pops are awesome.

VHi Guys! 4th of July is almost here and we\u2019re celebrating with My Habit by making a blueberry slab pie. The lazy man\u2019s pie, which is absolutely perfect for any 4th of July get together! We\u2019ve only added a small amount of sugar to the filling, providing a touch of sweetness against the tart lemon juice. If you can\u2019t find tapioca starch, feel free to use flour or corn starch. (the starch will be more useful in thickening the berry juice that forms while baking) You can also assemble this pie the evening before and bake it a couple hours before guests arrive. Not only will your house smell of delicious blueberry pie, but it\u2019ll also be as fresh as can be for your guests! Hop on over to My Habit\u2019s food blog, The Fix, for the full 
p11931

V When I was little my Dad used to make these mini peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of Ritz crackers. It was one of my favorite all time snacks. I still am very much into peanut butter and jelly. Now I love crunchy peanut butter and raspberry jelly on grainy wheat bread. So delicious. Being a big peanut butter fan I freaking love this ice cream. So creamy and so salty, this ice cream is the best peanut butter ice cream I have had. Why? Because it\u2019s perfectly balanced. Let me explain. A lot of peanut butter ice creams out there call for too much peanut butter, and then paired with the cream and sugar, it just becomes too much. This ice cream is is definitely peanut \u2013 buttery, but not too much so. If you have ritz on hand, you should absolutely make some ice cream sandwiches. It helps too if you assemble the sandwiches and stick them back in the freezer for a bit so they don\u2019t become a melty mess. :)

V\u000aHi Guys! Today we have cheesecake for you\u2026.but not any kind of cheesecake; one made with goat cheese and Greek yogurt! I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m not the biggest cheesecake fan. I started making cheesecakes when I was younger because it\u2019s my sister\u2019s favorite dessert and she was always requesting it for her birthday. (and if you know my sister, you know she\u2019s just like me, not a sweets person)
p12007
aVAnyway, I got really used to making one cracked and deflated cheesecake after another, wondering how places like the Cheesecake Factory got their cheesecakes so tall and perfect every time. Did they use some sort of special springform pan?As far as I was concerned, the springform pan was the most heinous tool in the kitchen. I get it..you can release the sides of the pan from the cake with ease\u2026but what about the bottom? You\u2019re pretty much stuck serving your cheesecake with the bottom of the pan still attached. (this became a bigger issue for me once I became a food stylist\u2026clients don\u2019t normally like to photograph cheesecakes with a big shiny piece of metal stuck to the bottom) Also, if you have one teeny tiny hold in your pain in the ass aluminum wrap contraption you\u2019ve basically signed up for a waterlogged dessert.
p12008
aVAnyway, this brings me to today\u2019s recipe and what I believe to be the most valuable piece of info I took away from culinary school. NO SPRINGFORM PAN NEEDED. For realz. Once my instructors helped me to see the light, I went home, threw all my springform pans away and set out to buy cake pans in all sizes. Really, all you need is a good quality cake pan, patience and a xanax (j/k on the last one). The cake board method I\u2019ve explained in the instructions below is perhaps the best way to bake and release a perfect cheesecake. You don\u2019t have to worry about weird, invisible foil tears that will prevent your cheesecake from rising perfectly, crack-free, nor do you have to worry about serving your cheesecake with a disc of pan still attached! A couple things that are important to this process is patience (the cheesecake really needs to be chilled thoroughly before being inverted to ensure you don\u2019t have a big mess on your hands) and fearlessness (you really need to be confident in your flipping and tapping to ensure success!) Worse comes to worse, you make a bit of a mess and you\u2019re still left with delicious cake! One last thing, please don\u2019t over bake this sucker. You really want the center to wobble for a second of two before pulling it from the oven so you know you\u2019ll have a super creamy cheesecake, which is the best!
p12009
aVThis recipe and especially process might seem a little intimidating, but it\u2019s really not! I promise!\u2026and if you\u2019re totally comfortable around your springform pan like I never was, go for it! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVLets get honest about gazpacho. When I first learned there was such a thing as cold soup I thought that idea was really disgusting. Soup is meant to hot, and filling, and so comforting that you should feel so good about yourself that you forget about all of your insecurities. Then you realize what gazpacho really is. Gazpacho is essentially a smoothie with the addition of tomatoes. That is if you don\u2019t normally put tomatoes in your smoothies, and if you do that\u2019s weird and I would then tell you its gazpacho. So learning that gazpacho is essentially a smoothie I looked at it a whole lot differently. I like smoothies. I bought a really expensive vitamix so I could make smoothies all the time. The thing about gazpacho is that you can add fun stuff like goat cheese and it\u2019s totally ok. Adding goat cheese to a smoothie would again, be really gross. This recipe for Strawberry and Tomato Gazpacho is so light and refreshing. It\u2019s one of those dishes you eat when it\u2019s a million degrees out and you need something other than a snow cone. I wonder if you all have or have had the same feelings about gazpacho as me. Please share!

VHi Guys! We\u2019re finishing the week with a couple of huge meatball subs, using our 
p12136
aV from Wednesday, which was made with the boldly delicious 
p12137
aV. I LOVE a good meatball sub and have been pretty obsessed with the one at Bay City Deli in Santa Monica for the past 4 years. It\u2019s so freakin\u2019 good. One thing I\u2019m not a fan of is waiting in line for an hour just to order the sub. The solution, make one myself. (in dire times like these, finding another suitable location could take days, if not weeks to find\u2026.meh, maybe I\u2019m being a tad bit dramatic..and now I ramble\u2026whatever)
p12138
aVANYWAY, we used an awesome beef blend from 
p12139
aV. (also my favorite website to order and send fabulous meat gifts to loved ones!) They offer a really fun, \u201cbuild a burger\u2019 on their website. You customize your own ground beef blend, up to 4 different kinds, and they freshly grind your handpicked blend for you before shipping it off! Everything is super fresh and it\u2019s fun to be able to pick and choose your burger blend to you own liking and taste.
p12140
aVLast week we offered a few picnic recipes, along with a fun picnic roundup and I think this sub would be a perfect addition. The way the marinara sauce just soaks into the soft, butter baguette, yet is secured by the toasted crust makes for a perfect traveling sandwich. While this sub is awesome piping hot, I\u2019ve been just as happy eating it straight from the fridge\u2026sort of like cold pizza\u2026it\u2019s all good. I hope everyone has an awesome weekend filled with lots of meatball \u201csub-age\u201d! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VHi Guys! Guess what? Spoon Fork Bacon turns 2 today! We\u2019re celebrating with a classic cake, devil\u2019s food. We\u2019ve been craving something rich and decadent and this cake really hit the spot. My favorite part about it though is the real fruit frosting! With berry season coming to an end, I\u2019ve been trying to do what everyone has been doing, jamming fresh berries (and stone fruit) into everything I possibly can. I love that you can really taste the strawberries in this frosting and that it\u2019s pretty easy to whip up. One piece of advice, don\u2019t add more of the strawberry puree into the frosting until the previous amount has been fully incorporated into the mixture. The consistency becomes a little gritty and wet if you rush this.
p12204
aVThank you all so much for your wonderful support throughout the last two years. Teri and I have had so much fun creating beautiful and delicious recipes/images for you all and look forward to continue banging out awesome stuff! Your comments/likes/pins/tweets\u2026(
p12205
aVall of it!) really help to drive our creativity and we appreciate the honest feedback!
p12206
aVAnyway, we hope everyone has an awesome weekend (we\u2019re taking tomorrow off!), doing fun things with loved ones! Enjoy! xx, Jenny
p12207
aV**Another small tip for the frosting is to add 1 tablespoon of milk powder to the puree before incorporating it into the butter and sugar. This will help to absorb some of the moisture without taking away the pink color!

aV This book is made for pancake lovers / breakfast lovers, and has 72 awesome recipes for pancakes of all kinds. While Pancakes has mostly breakfast pancake recipes (duh), she also has a entire section dedicated to dinner pancakes which is pretty cool. I picked this recipe because when we were shooting this book (I shot it, and Jenny food styled it!) I ate this and it was delicious. I ate the one we shot for this post also. So good! This recipe is for the huaraches, so you can add whatever toppings you like and it will be delicious. We added carnitas, iceberg lettuce, queso fresco, tomatoes, cilantro, and lime juice. Done. Easy. Delicious.

aV to a random person who comments on this post and tells us what their favorite way to eat pancakes are. You gotta remember to write your email in the email field so we can get a hold of you if you are the winner. We are taking entrants from now till Monday at 8am. So comment before then if you want to enter! Woo! A winner will be announced on this same post on Monday. Good luck!

VHi Guys! Today we have these jalapeno and cheddar cornmeal biscuits! I love a jalapeno-cheddar combo, cornmeal and biscuits so these little guys just made sense to me. I usually like replacing some or all of the butter in biscuit recipes with healthier options like greek yogurt and mashed sweet potatoes, but sometimes you just need a fatty biscuit. So today here you go, a cheesy, crusty, fatty biscuit!
p12345
aVThe addition of cornmeal to the mix is nice because it changes the texture. Giving you a crispier crust, but still leaves the inside buttery and soft. The perfect biscuit. You can scale the cheddar and jalapeno up or down to your liking, but as the boyfriend noticed you get the taste of jalapenos in this recipe without the heat, so if you\u2019re not a spicy type of person these biscuits should still be okay.
p12346
aVYou can use these guys to build delicious breakfast sandwiches or use them to dunk into hot (or cold) soup or eat them the way I like best, slightly warmed with a drizzle of honey\u2026.as I stand hovered over my kitchen sink devouring biscuit after biscuit, but I digress. I hope everyone has a great holiday weekend! xx, Jenny

aVWow. It\u2019s so hot in LA. I just got back from a little Labor Day trip over to Vancouver. My boyfriend (John) and I did a lot of activities. We went whale watching where we were basically on a boat that drove the Seattle and back where we saw Orcas in America. So that was funny. We went fishing for Salmon and didn\u2019t catch anything, which was a bummer. We ate food, met internet friends (Hi 
p12424
aV), and rode bikes. It was such great weather most of the time. Then I come home to this gross hotness that is LA. Ugh. Not fun at all. Where I grew up (Boise) we had quite the hot summers as well. Popsicles from Costco were always in the freezer, especially the yogurt kind. My favorite. Some people don\u2019t like the texture as much (ahehm Jenny), but I freaking love it! These Raspberry and Coconut popsicles make a wonderful creamy frozen treat. The coconut we used is shredded so it doesn\u2019t get break your teeth hard when it\u2019s frozen. You could also sub out the raspberries for something else if you prefer. Keep cool!

aVI don\u2019t bake enough delicious breakfast dishes on the weekends. I had my fling with baked oatmeal, and then savory bread pudding, but now I feel like there hasn\u2019t been another \u2018thing\u2019 to get me excited about mustering up the energy on a Sunday morning to put effort into baking. That was until I realized I actually liked crumb cake. My mom owned a coffee cart in the airport where I grew up. We had ginormous coffee bags delivered to the house every other day. They sat in the front near the door until she took them to work. As a child I thought coffee was gross, and I thought it stunk. The whole house constantly smelled like coffee, and I smelled like coffee. I hated it. I also ate a lot of what I thought were chocolate covered raisins which turned out to be chocolate covered coffee beans. I was under the impression that crumb cake only ever meant coffee crumb cake. So crumb cake was always something I never thought I would like. Even as an adult I don\u2019t really like coffee up in my stuff unless I am actually drinking coffee. So when I realized how much of a naïve dumb dumb I was being about crumb cakes, I tried this Blueberry and Cardamom Crumb Cake and was like whoa. Ok. I like crumb cake. That\u2019s neat. That means it is another delicious baking breakfast dish that needs to be experimented with. Yay. This should probably be added to your Sunday baking situations, it is to mine.

Today\u2019s recipe is this Mediterranean Style Farro Salad with a Shallot, Herb Vinaigrette. We both love making big batches of farro salads because they hold for days so well. Perfect for picnics as well as quick, on-the-go lunches.

VHi Guys! Is anyone participating in fantasy football? I am. I know, it\u2019s weird. I feel weird about it. This is my first time ever and I really have no idea what I\u2019m doing. (boyfriend may have even picked all my players for me during the draft\u2026that\u2019s cool, right?) Truth is some old college friends and I decided to start a league together this year. Even though I know absolutely nothing about football and this whole fantasy thing is super confusing to me, I love that I\u2019m doing it with my most vulgar, sh*t talking, hilarious, loud, witty group of girlfriends. It really makes this \u201cgame\u201d a lot more interesting and reminds me how lucky I am to have such amazing women in my life.
p12569
aVAnyway, because football season is here I thought something fun like burgers would be appropriate, but since I\u2019ve been trying to add a little more health and dietary balance into my life they would have to be veggie burgers\u2026delicious Big Veg Quinoa Burgers. Although the name of this burger is a play off the not so delicious Big Mac, the inspiration is really the In-N Out burger, special sauce and all! I really, really love these patties and was super excited that it got the double thumbs up from my not so veggie patty friendly boyfriend. They\u2019re a real mouthful and totally filled with lots of flavor. We used pretzel buns here because I like the heartiness, but swap it out for whichever you like. I\u2019m also a huge fan of eating this burger protein style, wrapped in crisp, cold lettuce\u2026 so freakin\u2019 good, you guys! If you want to get even more healthy, you can skip out on the basic thousand island dressing, but I personally thinks it gives it burger that slight In-N-Out taste.
p12570
aVThese Big Veg Quinoa Burgers are really easy to throw together (especially once the quinoa has cooked and cooled), but I\u2019ve got to say that allowing them to sit in the refrigerator for a while will make them hold together better when you cook them up. Happy football season, everyone! (I\u2019m totally just to pretend like I know what I\u2019m doing) Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aV\u000aHi Guys! Did everyone have a good long weekend? The boyfriend and I took it easy this weekend and went on a couple beach hikes, grilled a little and spent Labor Day celebrating our 3 year anniversary\u2026dog adopting anniversary that is. :) Yep, 3 years ago on Labor day we brought home, Dexter, who would soon become the love of our lives. We like to call him our \u201cLittle Sangria Pup\u201d because we adopted our beautiful mutt while buzzed off of way too much Sangria at Fiesta Hermosa (a Memorial and Labor Day beach festival in Hermosa beach with craft and food vendors, live music, etc.). There was animal adoption booth at the festival and of course I had to drag Jordan over to the pups to take a look. It was actually the boyfriend that locked eyes with him and determined that Dexter would be coming home with us that evening. I was thrilled!!!!!!\u2026 and now he basically runs our lives\u2026and we love it.
p12652
aVAnyway, back to today\u2019s recipe. Unfortunately its been so disgustingly hot out that I haven\u2019t been able to bake these muffins in a little while, but I do love these big ol\u2019 Giant Roasted Grape Muffins. Grapes have become one of my favorite fruits to roast. There\u2019s so much sugar in them that they practically turn into candy when roasted. Delicious! (although this also means you need to be careful not to burn them and your baking sheet while roasting them) The muffins themselves are great; large, moist, fluffy with a great cake-y texture. You can really add anything to them depending on your preference\u2026blueberries, currants, chocolate chips, bananas, poppy seeds, really whatever you want! I chose the roasted grapes because I love the flavor and like I said earlier, I\u2019m digging roasted grapes at the moment.
p12653
aVMaybe it\u2019s too hot to bake muffins right now, but these guys just might be worth the trouble. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VWe made this cute tart for you to make to celebrate life with. It\u2019s a Red Apricot and Sweet Cherry Tart with a Cashew Frangipane. We invite you to welcome in autumn and say bye bye to summer with this tart. We decided to use these gorgeous Red Velvet Apricots, or plum-cots. These apricots have a beautiful deep red skin with rich golden flesh. Their texture is very much plum like with the taste of both apricots and plum, hence the name plum-cots. If you can\u2019t find these it\u2019s ok, you can sub for regular apricots or even plums. We love the sweet and tart flavor the Red Apricots give this tart, which is a really nice compliment to the rich and nutty baked cashew custard. We also used sweet cherries to add a just a touch more of autumn. We surrounded all of this goodness with a simple shortbread crust. This really is autumn in a tart, and we hope you will enjoy it!

VHi Guys! Today with have these fun Peanut Butter & Jelly and Potato Chip Bars. These bars are a throwback to the classic pb&j sandwich. Pb&j sandwiches just scream childhood (well and actually college too) to me and I feel like I\u2019ve rarely, if ever eaten a pb&j sandwich without stuffing a bunch of potato chips into it first.  Who was the first person to think of doing that? I\u2019d like to give them a hug and thank them for creating an incredible combo of flavors.
p12788
aVThese guys are pretty easy to whip up. After you make the peanut butter dough it pretty much becomes all about layering\u2026.super simple! For some reason these also remind me of the fall and staying cozy. I\u2019m totally ready for fall, cool weather and cute cold weather clothes\u2026enough with the heat already!
p12789
aVAnyway, the next time you\u2019re in the mood to bake something like brownies or cookies think about baking these Peanut Butter & Jelly and Potato Chip Bars instead\u2026something a little different, that\u2019s totally delicious. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V You guys are so nice. I can\u2019t even being to tell you how much I appreciate all your nice comments about my senior cat. I love you guys! This weekend I spent a lot of time cuddling and loving on my cat. I also did some retail therapy, which included some handmade shoes and amazing new plates to add to my collection. I also spent a lot of time watching master chef and repeating the cute little kid at the end that says \u201cone potato two potato.\u201d So that was fun. I also went to the farmers market and bought too much stuff like I do every weekend. I always think I will eat more than I actually do. My eyes are way bigger than my stomach apparently. I hate wasting food, which is why we made this simple little recipe from Black Plum Preserves. Two ingredients, no pectin, and lots of deliciousness. We are probably going to post another recipe using this Black Plum Preserves. Yum.
p12861
aVI also wanted to share this BEAUTIFUL knife 
p12862
aV gave us. I was the one who got to take it home (yay me!) because all my knifes are old and have never been sharpened. New knifes are mind blowing when you have been cutting dull ones. This knife is like something I have always wanted, a mini kitchen light saber. Bonus: they are all sustainable and made in the USA. So that\u2019s pretty neat.

VWe have been posting lots of desserts lately. It\u2019s making me a little sweets crazy. I try and keep copious amounts of sweets out of my house because I know what will happen. If I know there are sweets in the house, I basically just think about them all day until I no longer have the strength to stay away and then eat it all. Last night I was watching Newsroom with John (BF) and he came back into the room with mint chocolate covered pretzels to share. Sneaky, because where the hell did those come from and how come I didn\u2019t know they existed till now? Have you guys had mint chocolate covered pretzels? It\u2019s like a thin mint only better because of the salt! It\u2019s gonna become my new favorite. So the other sweet I wanna talk about today are these Individual Apple Crisps. First I want to talk about how great individual sizes are. For someone who has a boyfriend who takes bites that are like 5 times the size of my normal bites, I appreciate that it is very clear that this is my portion and that is your portion. You get what I am saying? Second you can have your eaters put whatever else on it they want. Like ice cream AND caramel sauce, whipped cream, or anything. These would be so perfect for Thanksgiving, or fall dinner parties. Cute stuff. Enjoy!

VToday\u2019s recipe is the result of another Jordan \u201cBLOG-WORTHY\u201d freak out! As a lover of baklava, he has to have a piece every time we run across some, and this time was no different. Except this time when he took a bite he was unexpectedly, but very pleasantly surprised to find a nice layer of rich and creamy cheese in the center! Neither of us have ever seen this before but it makes total sense! How could creamy cheese not go well with flaky, crispy crust, sweet honey, and toasty nuts?! I\u2019m not quite sure it was brie that the restaurant was using, but it seemed to make the most sense to me so that\u2019s what we\u2019re using today for our own baklava!
p12941
aVJust a bit of layering, brushing and sprinkling involved in this recipe. So easy and they\u2019re so delicious! So go make them and share them, because everyone deserves a little Brie Filled Baklava in their lives. ;) xx, Jenny

aV\u000ait\u2019s for an amazing Ginger Infused Italian Cream Cake! We feel like we don\u2019t bake cakes as often as we should. They are normally reserved for celebrations and the like, and we feel as though that is mostly the case because cakes can be a pain. This one though is pretty neat because you don\u2019t have to have a degree in art to make it look pretty. No crumb coating and fancy piping tips necessary! We also love this cake because of all the layers! The height of this cake is super impressive to guests and the decorating technique is actually less fussy and intimidating than most! You can opt out on the candied citrus wheels, but we think it really adds a gorgeously, finished look to the cake.
p12996
aVThe infused candied-ginger flavor is delicious in this moist cake and pairs quite nicely with the orange-kissed frosting. Although a cream cake, it\u2019s not as dense as you would think and the not overtly sweet nature of the cake allows for one to eat more without feeling over- whelmed\u2026 and more cake is always alright by us. You can find this recipe and lots of other amazing ones right

VHi Guys! Fall is finally here!!! We\u2019re starting this season off right with cozy biscuits\u2026cheesy beet biscuits to be exact! I love coloring foods with beets, it\u2019s so easy, natural and the results are always so stunning. You can taste a slight earthiness to these biscuits, but the buttery, flaky, cheesy goodness of the comte cheese is the predominant flavor.
p13008
aVI\u2019ve been on a pretty crazy job this last week and things aren\u2019t really going to slow down for me anytime soon. I can\u2019t complain though\u2026although I do long for a night where I get more than 3 hours of sleep, but in the end it\u2019ll all be worth it! When I\u2019m feeling highly stressed, like right now, it\u2019s so funny how something as simple as a warm and delicious biscuit can turn your whole day around. You know those stress balls people squeeze in their hands? Well these are my stress biscuits. **Eat one every 4 to 6 hours or as needed to reduce stress and satisfy hunger pangs\u2026.then thank me later. ;) Enjoy! xx, Jenny

We all know how much Jenny loved Friends. I think I am in love with Schmidt, because he just talks about food all the time. Every show I watch I fall in love with one character. On Friends it was Ross, That 70\u2032s Show it was Eric, News Room it\u2019s Jim AND Neal. Do you guys get crushes on people that are in shows you watch? I am so curious.
p13065
aVI feel like Schmidt from New Girl would totally approve of this Basic Pavlova with Macerated Berries recipe we have for you today. Have you ever had pavlova? Just by looking at it I thought I wouldn\u2019t like it so much. I thought it would be like eating chalk with berries on top. The inside of the pavlova is actually cake-y and light and fluffy. My favorite part of the process of baking this is that when it\u2019s out of the oven and beautiful and perfect, then you ruin it by smacking the top with a spoon and breaking it. That part is the best, and also allows the berries and their juices to seep in and create a beautiful delicious mess. It\u2019s crazy how easy this is to make, and it is so impressive looking. Think about it the next time you have to make dessert for people!

VI am very happy to report that it is kind of raining here in LA. For those of you that don\u2019t know, LA is always sunny and nice. Sometimes, especially lately, it\u2019s been too hot. So this rain is such a nice break. I realized last night that the nice weather here all the time is just too much. Although I don\u2019t want it to snow or anything (lets not get crazy), I do wish there were more seasons. Los Angeles transforms into this super romantic please when it rains, and I wish that happened more. The smell after rain is so fresh and different. You don\u2019t see as many people on the streets, and it becomes quite and very eerily calm. Everything is so much more green and alive. I feel more alive, even if that means I am laying in bed watching the rain dripping down my window and cuddling with cats, or watching Friends episodes and trying decide which character I am most (I think it\u2019s Phoebe).
p13119
aVIt\u2019s rainy days like these that make the kitchen seem like a great place to spend time in. I don\u2019t know what it is about the rain, but I think it strikes some kind of natural urge in all of us to eat something cozy, something fortifying. I would like to suggest our Almond Butter Soba Noodles with Garlic Shrimp. This dish is really filling and different than what might first pop into your mind when you think of cold weather food. You might first think of using peanut butter in this dish, but the almond butter gives it a lighter feel and a creamier texture. The garlic shrimp are delicious and gives this dish a bite. I would give this dish an A+ for being a great rain weather choice.

VIt\u2019s Sweet Potato Smoothie time! This is one of those recipes you should use when you buy stuff for dinner and then never actually make dinner and order pizza instead. We have all been there, and being a big fan of potatoes I always purchase them. I like to imagine making fluffy mashed potatoes, tater tots, a gratin; you know something that will be a delicious way to consume carbs. Sadly, there are times when I come home and the last thing I want to do is turn the oven or stove on. I can however handle turning on my vitamix to make delicious and amazing smoothies. So with this simple Sweet Potato Smoothie recipe you can use leftover sweet potatoes that were possibly once destined for carb indulging side dishes.  You can slurp this smoothie down for breakfast or dessert or anytime. God, I love smoothies.

VNothing quite screams comfort to us like a delicious breakfast sandwich. We\u2019ve taken the idea of a fast food breakfast sandwich on an English muffin and added our own, slightly elevated twist for our Toasted Breakfast Sandwich. We doubled the meat, using both seared, smoked ham and crispy bacon, but then also added some saute\u0301ed spinach for a Florentine feel and further bulked up our sandwich with saute\u0301ed cremini mushrooms.

VThis is one of my favorite doughnut situations we have ever posted. I am very excited about it because it is what I have always wanted in an apple fritter. Let me start off first by saying that apple fritters are one of my favorite things to get at the doughnut shop. I especially flip over them if they have just been made and are still warm. There are a few things that I really don\u2019t like about some places that make them. First is too much cinnamon. Apple Fritters are not cinnamon rolls, so chill on the cinnamon please. Some places are super stingy on their apple filling. It\u2019s shocking because it most likely came from the can, like the weird apple and cherry pie filling you can get at the market. So why be stingy with it? Fill it up! I want it in every nook and cranny! That is what makes these Apple Fritter Rings perfect. The apple the dough ratio is pretty much set, so you know you\u2019re going to get warm apple in every bite. Awesome. We took a chill pill when it came to cinnamon, I think this is important. We made our glaze with real vanilla beans, so it tastes like magic. We also made these Apple Fritter Rings with

aVHi Guys! Today we have a healthy meatless Monday recipe for you all; a simple and versatile Vegan Cauliflower Cream Sauce! Teri and I recently finished shooting a couple paleo and vegan cookbooks and the experience has totally inspired me to play around in the kitchen and try my hand at a few vegan and paleo friendly recipes myself.  First up is this \u201ccream\u201d sauce. We tossed our sauce with pasta to make a quick and satisfying meal (that won\u2019t weight you down!), but you can also use this as a sauce paired with different cooked proteins and even as a dipping sauce for veggies, both fresh and steamed!
p13347
aVI\u2019m not going to try and convince you that this sauce tastes exactly like an alfredo sauce or a full fat cream sauce because it totally doesn\u2019t. I will say that it\u2019s a wonderful healthy alternative for when you\u2019re getting a hankering for something rich and creamy, but don\u2019t want to compromise your waistline.  I like to have meals like this a few times a week, especially during the chilly fall and winter months when all I\u2019m craving is rich, creamy, decadent foods but don\u2019t want to gain 100 pounds by next spring! I\u2019m no vegan cooking expert, not by a long shot ,and I know that it can be intimidating but I think this recipe is a great intro recipe to vegan cooking. It only has a few ingredients and is really easy to throw together. Plus you can adjust the ingredient amounts according to your own personal taste. Can\u2019t find nutritional yeast or just not into it? No problem, just sub it out for any cheese alternative of your choice! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VHi Guys! Today we have a fun recipe for you all\u2026DIY pasta WITH four flavor variations and drying instructions! I really like making my own pasta (part of the DIY food obsession I have that I mentioned earlier this week), but it\u2019s definitely a labor of love. These days I\u2019m lucky enough to have a stand mixer to mix and bring my dough together, plus fancy pasta attachments to easily roll and cut my dough without having to demonstrate my pathetic arm strength, but these things are totally not necessary to make wonderful pasta at home!
p13399
aVWe use a blend of all purpose and semolina flours because I like the firm texture the semolina adds to the dough and overall final product and all purpose flour is usually something everyone has on hand. You can get all authentic and serious if you want and pick up or order (via the internets) some \u201c00 flour\u201d (doppio zero flour) which is an Italian flour that is is great for pasta and pizza doughs because of its fine texture, which when used results in a silky, supple dough. I have used it a couple times (specifically ones with lower protein %, because I blend my flour with semolina) and did quite enjoy it, but again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to go out of your way to find and buy \u201c00 flour\u201d (which can be rather expensive) if you just want to make a quick dough. There are many purists out there who would disagree with me so it\u2019s really up to you!
p13400
aVWe included basic drying instructions because I began to notice that almost every time I would make my own pasta, I was unable to use the entire ball of dough quick enough, before it would go bad. I like using the hang dry method over the nesting method because I like the thorough and even drying you achieve where as with the nesting method it\u2019s easier to develop mold due to improper \u201ccoiling\u201d and unseen wet spots. If you don\u2019t have a pasta drying rack, you can always use wire hangers, which is what I did for a couple years before finally investing $20 into a wooden drying rack.

V1. For dough: In a mixing bowl combine flours and whisk together. On a clean work surface or in a bowl place 1 1/2 cups of flour mixture in a mound. Make a well in the center of flour and crack eggs into well, followed by oil.
p13432
aV2. Using a fork gently whisk eggs and oil together while slowly incorporating flour. Once flour and eggs are combined, add more flour little by little to form a ball that is no longer sticky to touch.
p13433
aV3. If dough is dry add water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Knead dough for 8-10 minutes (dough should feel very tight and should bounce back when gently pressed), wrap in plastic and let sit for about 20 minutes before using. Follow pasta machine instructions for rolling out the dough and cutting into desired pasta type (or roll pasta dough by hand with a rolling pin until very thin and cut into desired pasta type, using a clean ruler for even noodles).

aV4. To color dough: Add \u201cflavors\u201d to eggs beat together before adding mixture to well of flour mixture. Continue following basic pasta dough instructions.

V\u000aHi Guys! Today we have homemade harissa for you! Harissa is a spicy North African (although there are a number of varieties from all over) condiment that has a wonderful flavor. You can add it to pretty much whatever you want. I love stirring a little bit into my soups or even infusing a little bit into some of my sauces to give it a unique kick.
p13463
aVSince I was a little girl I\u2019ve been fascinated with DIY cooking projects at home. I just find them very interesting, exciting and I love the whole \u201clabor of love\u201d thing, I really do. I feel accomplished when I tackle things like kimchi, ketchup, whole grain mustard, sausages, bacon, etc. There\u2019s not too much that excites me more than being able to uncover and rinse something like my own my side of freshly cured pork belly after days and days of waiting, adjusting and waiting again. I think this is all because my mom made everything from scratch growing up and condiments was up there on her list. Although they were usually Korean foods/condiments she was making from scratch, I think it just gave me an overall itch to get my own DIY juices flowing.
p13464
aVAnyway, that takes us back to this harissa. I learned about this tasty condiment for the first time in culinary school, about 6 years ago, and have been in love ever since. Today we have two versions for you; I call them \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cspicy\u201d, but just a fair warning that they\u2019re both quite spicy. One is just a thicker, more authentic North African kind of paste (the \u201cspicy\u201d), while the other is toned down with a roasted bell pepper and a bit more sauce-like. Another thing to mention is that I use ground spices for one of the recipes while instructing to use whole spices and to grind them yourself for the other recipe. You can use pre-ground spices for both if you want, no problem! I just included super basic instructions for both incase some people prefer to toast and grind there own spices\u2026like me! Want to know the best thing about this condiment? It\u2019s actually not a \u201clabor of love\u201d, it\u2019s totally easy and you still get to feel very accomplished as you spoon your harissa into little jars.
p13465
aVWith the holidays right around the corner, can you think of anyone special in your life that might want a delicious jar of homemade harissa?\u2026maybe, yes?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VToday we have another fun little DIY holiday gift for you. This one is a personal favorite for us because we would both LOVE to get this. Jenny and I have a thing for champagne and especially adding a little something extra. Which is why we thought making a trio Homemade Champagne Simple Syrups to gift with these beautiful 
p13554
aV was a great idea. These simple syrups are so great because you can add them to champagne, or nearly any cocktail drink to quickly and easily fancy it up. We made three flavors: sweet rose, ginger pear, and honey lavender. You could make one or all three to gift with these Perrier-Jouët InBloom Fresh Boxes. We designed these labels with the Fresh Bloom Boxes in mind because together they just make such an amazing hostess gift. Lets talk about how to do this. Here is what you need:

VWe have a quick little recipe or you today for Brown Butter Biscuits. Love these little duded. The browned butter gives an amazing depth of flavor that you just can\u2019t get any other way. These little biscuits would be great for Thanksgiving, or just morning time with honey and jam! Are you all getting your Thanksgiving preparations together? How is that going? Stressful I bet. Last time I made Thanksgiving, the grocery list made me want to throw up. So long. If you guys need any last minute recipes be sure to check out our Thanksgiving section on the site! Hope you all will enjoy your sliver of time off for the holiday, and eat lots of good food!

V\u000aHappy New Year! You may or may not be as hung over as we are right about now. There are a couple of things that really help us out when we feel horrible after a night of celebration. One of them is our 
p13615
aV recipe, and the other are Green Smoothies. We made this Green Smoothie with one of our most favorite kitchen appliances ever: A Vitamix. If you are in the market for a blender, we highly recommend it. It pulverizes everything like nothing else. This is one of my favorite recipes for a Green Smoothie because of the pineapple. I can\u2019t take a straight up Green Smoothie that tastes like you\u2019re drinking grass, so the addition of the pineapple really does the deed in this smoothie. Drink up!

V1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
p13677
aV2. Place water, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
p13678
aV3. Add flour and stir with a wooden spoon 3 minutes or until a sticky dough forms. Pour dough into a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and beat for 2 minutes to release some steam. Add eggs one at a time, mixing and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.
p13679
aV4. Scoop dough into a piping bag fitted with a round tip (Ateco #806) and pipe 1/2 tablespoon sized balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until puffs have puffed and turned golden brown. Allow puffs to cool slightly before poking holes in the sides to release the steam. Place puffs back onto the baking sheet and allow to dry out in a warm oven for about 15 minutes.
p13680
aV5. Once puffs have cooled completely melt together sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water. Bring mixture to a boil and using a candy thermometer, boil sugar until 240\u02daF has been reached.
p13681
aV6. Remove from heat and allow sugar to cool slightly. Spray a sheet of parchment with cooking spray and use as a surface.
p13682
aV7. Carefully dip a puff into the melted sugar and stick onto another puff. Continue to do so until a 6 inch disc has been made.
p13683
aV8. Begin creating a cone, using the disc as a base, incorporating the truffles randomly throughout the tree (be careful when using the sugar against the truffles as too much will make them melt excessively).
p13684
aV9. Once a small tree has been made, set aside and dry while a sugar nest is made.
p13685
aV10. Cut the rounded 1 inch end of a whisk with wire cutters and carefully discard loose pieces. Line a 9\u201dx13\u201d baking dish with parchment and lightly coat with cooking spray.
p13686
aV11. Place sugar back over heat and melt until mixture reaches 240\u02daF (add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed).
p13687
aV12. Place altered whisk into mixture and whisk. Allow thicker drops of sugar fall before quickly placing the whisk over the prepared baking dish and shaking the whisk back and forth until a long \u201cnest\u201d has formed.
p13688
aV13. Gently take the ends of the \u201cnest\u201d and place it around the truffled tree to create a sash and allow the sugar to set.

V\u000aDid everyone have a good Christmas? I was in Idaho, where it wasn\u2019t as cold as I would have thought. There was snow on the ground, but nothing fresh. It was the kind of snow that was crunchy, and for some reason I always think about freezer burn when I encounter this kind of snow. My favorite part is this beef rib roast my step mom makes. It is so juicy and the texture is perfection. She also made my favorite potatoes in all the land, Heavenly Potatoes. I try and save myself so be able to fill up on the beef, predictable. I felt like a balloon when I came home. John and I went off to Boston for New Years. When we returned, all we are trying to eat will be light and yummy food. Which is why we have this Roasted Cauliflower and Parsnip Soup for you. Here is the deal with this soup, the cauliflower is great because it has a similar texture and mouth feel to potatoes but with less carbs! Hooray! The parsnips are so delicious when roasted because they just get a little sweeter. When we puree all these ingredients together to make this soup, it really feels as though you are eating a creamy rich soup. I think it is a perfect start to the new year when you still may crave all the rich foods you have been eating, but don\u2019t actually want to eat them.

V1. Preheat oven to 375\u02daF.
p13743
aV2. Spread cauliflower, parsnips, shallots, garlic, and thyme onto a baking sheet, in a single layer, and drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with cumin, paprika, salt and pepper and toss everything together until the vegetables are well coated with oil.
p13744
aV3. Roast vegetables for 25-30 minutes, tossing vegetables around 15 minutes into the roasting process.
p13745
aV4. Meanwhile pour stock into a medium pot and bring to a simmer. Lightly season with salt and pepper.
p13746
aV5. Once vegetables have roasted through and stock is hot, transfer both the vegetables and 2 1/2 cups stock into the well of a blender. Securely fasten the lib, but remove the small, plastic center-top and replace that with a kitchen towel with your hand securely over the towel (this will allow for the stream to escape without a soup \u2018explosion\u2019 occurring).
p13747
aV6. Puree mixture for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture is smooth. Add more stock and continue to puree if necessary.
p13748
aV7. Transfer the mixture into the pot that the stock was in and bring to a light simmer. Stir in sour cream or crème fraiche and adjust seasonings.
p13749

Getting back into the swing of things has been really difficult. I\u2019m going to bed super late, and waking up really early, and I generally feel weird. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s me missing Tokyo, or the weird mental state no sleep is giving me, but either way I hope to be back to normal soon.

V\u000aIt\u2019s been just a little bit slow around here lately. We are working on some new big projects that we will be able to share with you in what seems like forever. I just wanted to remind you that we have totally not forgotten about you! I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time at home working and watching tv in the background. Most recently I\u2019ve been watching the Twilight series. Totally embarrassing I know, I really have a thing for saga series. Harry Potter and Star Wars are my usual go to, so I decided to watch Twilight to mix things up. It\u2019s so bad, it\u2019s good. Sometimes when the bad acting mixed with horrible writing happens all at once on the screen I totally get embarrassed and turn red, even though I am by myself. The reason I do like Twilight is because it is so bad it\u2019s good. Much like these Chocolate Chunk and Cinnamon Scones. They are so bad it\u2019s good in a different way. So bad, as in we made scones be yet another vehicle for the consumption of chocolate. Good, because you\u2019re eating chocolate. So let\u2019s be so bad it\u2019s good together and eat these Chocolate Chunk and Cinnamon Scones and watch Twilight.

VHi Guys! Today we have some quick and easy apple-cinnamon pancakes with the most decadent of syrup\u2026.a brown sugar-buttermilk syrup. I feel almost wrong for calling this syrup as it should really be called \u2018buttermilk caramel-awesome sauce\u2019, but for breakfast purposes we\u2019re just going to call it syrup..seems much more appropriate.
p13973
aVAnyway, these pancakes could be the perfect thing to wake up to New Years Day! After a long night of drinking, aren\u2019t you supposed to carb load anyway, to soak up all the booze? So along with being super indulgent and delicious these pancakes are kind of like a hangover cure\u2026kind of. If you don\u2019t booze it up on New Years Eve, I think it\u2019s still okay to scarf a few dozen of these down\u2026I actually highly encourage it.
p13974
aVIf you\u2019re going the healthy resolution route this New Years, don\u2019t worry: 1) You still have a couple days to go to town on dish 2) We have a healthy \u201cdetox-ish\u201d drink coming \u2018atcha a little later this week! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V1. For buttermilk syrup: Melt butter in medium pot (should be a tall pot). Once butter has melted, add both sugars and water to the pot and stir until all sugar is well coated.
p14023
aV2. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove mixture from heat and add baking soda (be very careful as the mixture will bubble up). Once baking soda has been added, stir the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes until it begins to settle. Stir in vanilla and salt until fully incorporated. Pour syrup into a small carafe and set aside until ready to use.
p14024
aV3. For pancakes: Place flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Add buttermilk, eggs and butter and stir with fork until mixture has just come together and no dry pockets remain. Fold in apples until just combined.
p14025
aV4. Melt 2 tablespoons butter onto a griddle, in a cast iron pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/3 cup batter onto the buttered pan and allow pancakes to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Once you see the edges begin to cook and air bubbles popping on the surface, flip pancakes and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
p14026
aV5. Transfer finished pancakes onto a baking sheet (you can keep finished pancakes in a warm [200\u02daF] oven while the remaining pancakes cook) and repeat until all the batter has been used.
p14027
aV6. Serve pancakes with the brown sugar, buttermilk syrup and more butter, if desired.

She said something like \u201cI like these cookies, but why is there salt on them.\u201d I have no comment, other than that\u2019s like asking why there is jelly on this pb & j.

VWhen I was coming of age in Idaho, during the weekends my friends and I would hang out at coffee shops. It wasn\u2019t like how people hang out at coffee shops now, where they essentially go there and work. We would hang out there and basically do nothing, because there was nothing to do. I remember we all got chai lattes, because coffee was still pretty gross to us. In fact, I think chai was my bridge to coffee. As soon as I went to college and had to pull all nighters all the time, the chai latte morphed into a dirty chai and just kept getting dirtier and dirtier. I don\u2019t really drink chai lattes ever anymore, but I still love them. So when we decided to make this Banana Chai Cake I was really excited. I love banana bread, and banana dessert in general, so this Banana Chai Cake is like a really awesome food marriage that would have ideally existed back when my friends and I were coffee house loiterers. We like to serve this with whipped cream, or ice cream. Plain is good too though!

You have a quail egg (pretentious? sorta), and then breakfast sausage (not even close to pretentious), IN ONE. Plus its fried, so that should give it like +5 un-pretentious points. its delicious, and pretty. How can you not like breakfast compacted into a small little meat ball? I dunno.

Only this was a good unexpected surprise. They are basically delicious little fried morsels (I hate that word, couldn\u2019t think of a better one). The good thing is, they are beans, which is kinda healthy right? I also heard somewhere ( I think it was Perez Hilton\u2019s fit site (BIG JK)) that curry prevents joint swelling. So there you go.

I wonder who the next celebrity that gets weird nude photos stolen off their phone will be? I hope I don\u2019t burn things. So there is that going through my head. Constant circle of thoughts that is never ending. I know some of you are probably Thanksgiving veterans, so if you have any words of advice, I will very much appreciate it.

The tops kind of remind me of my hair when I wear it up. This is a bad thing, and now I will reconsider my go to hairstyle. Anyway, these are actually a great appetizer for parties. They are gorgeous, and easy. Not to mention the ingredients lend itself to Thanksgiving. We also have a lot of other appetizer recipes in our recipe index if you are looking for something specific.

aVHi All! We\u2019re really excited over here at SFB because today we\u2019re doing our first cookbook review. This is something we have thought a lot about. We draw a lot of inspiration from cookbooks and thought we would share some of the books that stuck out to us. We thought that : 
p14811
aV was super fitting for our first review because we are bacon fanatics. For those of you who don\u2019t know Libbie Summer\u2019s she\u2019s the very talented food stylist for Food Network\u2019s Paula Dean. When we received our copies of the book we were totally stoked by the title. It\u2019s a great cookbook that really does live up to its title; it picks the pig apart from head to toe and even goes into offal meats, curing your own bacon and making your own leaf lard (great for pastry/pie doughs). It\u2019s a great resource for somebody looking for delicious and informative pork recipes. The graphic design is also refreshing and simple, and super cute. Don\u2019t forget to take a peek under the dust jacket!

VHoliday time is officially here! Okay, so in theory the holidays are great, but really they\u2019re stressful and expensive. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still love holiday time, but it is what it is. Something I like doing to alleviate some holiday stress is give homemade food items as gifts..particularly sweets and baked goods. This is one of those things I\u2019m definitely going to make. I\u2019m going to package them up in really cute Martha Stewart holiday craft gift boxes and give them away as small tasty gifts. I had chocolate covered Ritz crackers for the first time last year. Oh man, after I ate my first one I was on a mission to hoard boxes of this \u201climited edition\u201d stuff for the next month\u2026. I thought they were

aVSo there\u2019s this place called E&O Trading Co. in San Fran and they have these AMAZING corn cakes, well technically they\u2019re called \u201cIndonesian Corn Fritters\u201d and I\u2019ll say it again\u2026they\u2019re AMAZING! Okay, now here\u2019s the thing\u2026.I\u2019ve never actually had the fritters nor have I ever been to the restaurant. Then why am I being a freak and raving about something I\u2019ve never had?? Well, I\u2019m a very visual person and I saw them being pimped out on a food show one time and became kind of obsessed. I have problems, I know. They also went into the kitchen where they filmed the chef make a giant batch, so naturally I drove to the store right away to pick up some ingredients to make these. I changed around some of the ingredients and added some red corn, because I found some at the market and thought it would be pretty. I wasn\u2019t disappointed\u2026these things are SO good\u2026especially if you make a little honey and Sambal sauce (spicy chili sauce) dipping sauce. I love that they\u2019re pretty much all corn kernels with no batter. It\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s simple. Try it. The End :)

aVIts kinda cold here in LA (47 degrees, don\u2019t laugh). In fact, this is the first time ever in this apartment that I have lived in for three years, that I turned the heat on. It was scary. The fire alarm went off a lot. I was expecting a lot of bad smells because the gas heater would have to burn through cat hair and dust that made it through the vent, but that didn\u2019t happen. It was great. Now my apartment is super warm. So this whole cold thing makes it feel a bit more holiday like. I\u2019ve watched Elf 5 times already this month. Such a good movie. I have my mini pink Christmas tree up with the ornaments secured to the tree (my cats are brats), and a couple of strings of lights up. I am looking forward to going to some Holiday parties, and seeing my family in cold ass Idaho. Mostly though, I am looking forward to going to parties where you have to bring food. Then you show up, and food destroy everyone. What does food destroy mean you ask? It means your food tastes better and looks better than what everyone else brought. You know it, and they all know it. The girl that brought the gross orange looking dip will stare you down because her casserole dish of nastiness is still in tact while your stuff is gone. This may seem childish and stupid, but whatever. Its my thing, and yes, I secretly judge you as a person for whatever food you bring to a party. So I encourage you all to go to parties with the intent to food destroy everyone. These Cracked Out Rice Krispies Treats are a pretty good start. The creative and funny name will give you extra points.

VHi Guys. A couple of months ago, we were asked by the nice people over at 
p15071
aVto go to this event called a \u201cfoodie meet up\u201d at 
p15072
aV restaurant in Venice beach. Joe himself made us table side tuna tartare which was amazing, something you might see our take on in the future\u2026and by we might, we mean you will :) Anyways, after our fabulous dinner we were invited to stay and watch a demo on this nifty little machine called NesCafe\u2019s Dolce Gusto. It\u2019s a single cup coffee maker that initially seems to be jumping on the \u201ck-cup\u201d band wagon, that is until you realize it makes legit specialty drinks as well as regular coffee\u2026including SKINNY LATTES. Hello?! It\u2019s awesome.
p15073
aVWe were each lucky enough to score one of these machines for attending the event and since everything we do translates back to food, we thought we\u2019d give all you rad folks a fun coffee recipe. Enter little vanilla sponge cakes\u2026dowsed in coffee\u2026.covered in coffee buttercream (REAL French buttercream thankyouverymuch)\u2026. rolled in toasted, sliced almonds. Yep, that\u2019s right. These cakes are sort of a weird little version of the classic dobos torte\u2026minus the fun caramel wheel on top. So go out and make these cakes because they\u2019re cute and tasty. Maybe enjoy some cake with your new

V1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
p15107
aV2. Using a stand mixer, fixed with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, scraping down after each addition. Carefully stir the flour into the mixture and mix until just combined. Set aside.
p15108
aV3. Place the egg whites in a clean stand mixing bowl and beat with a whisk attachment. As the egg whites become frothy begin adding the powdered sugar until all has been used. Add the vanilla and continue to bat until stiff peaks form. Fold the white mixture into the yolk mixture until just combined.
p15109
aV4. Spread a thin layer of the mixture onto two baking sheets lined with parchment and lightly greased. Place the baking sheets into the oven and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool.
p15110
aV5. While the sponge cakes bake, make the frosting: Place the sugar, water and corn syrup into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Place the egg yolks in a stand mixer, fixed with a paddle attachment and whip until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Once the melted sugar mixture has reached 240°F remove from the heat.
p15111
aV6. With the motor of the stand mixer running, slowly pour the sugar mixture into the whipped yolks, in a steady and thin stream.(making sure the eggs don\u2019t scramble)
p15112
aV7. Once all the sugar has been incorporated, begin adding the cubes of cold butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Continue whipping the butter until all has been used and the mixture is light, fluffy and smooth. Fold in the coffee. extract until just combined. Set aside until ready to use.
p15113
aV8. Once the cakes have cooled, use a 3.5 inch circle cutter and cut 10 circles from each sheet pan. Gently remove the circles from each sheet pan.
p15114
aV9. Place a small dot of frosting onto the center surface of a cake stand and place a cake circle over it. Using a pastry brush, dab the surface with a small amount of coffee to moisten and flavor the cake.
p15115
aV10. Spread an even layer of frosting over the coffee doused cake circle and top with another cake circle. Repeat with the coffee and frosting until a five layer cake has been made. Add a thin crumb coat of frosting around the sides and top of the cake and set onto a sheet pan lined with parchment. Repeat with the remaining cake circles until a total of 4 mini cakes have been made.
p15116
aV11. Place cakes in fridge and allow the cakes to chill, about 2 hours. Place another even layer of frosting around each cake and coat the sides with the toasted almonds. Serve.

VIf french fries and onion rings ever got married and had a baby, I think it would be something like this\u2026a potato ring. You have a light and crispy outer coating with a soft potato and caramelized onion center\u2026why? Because we can I guess, who knows\u2026but it\u2019s kind of fun, right?! My boyfriend and his friends have this thing where every super bowl they have a \u201cDeep-Fry Fest\u201d where, well they deep fry everything; so if you\u2019re anything like my boyfriend you now have another \u201cDeep Fry Fest\u201d recipe to use! Two things I can\u2019t stress enough is: 1) the importance of having the potatoes completely coated; 
p15138
aV please, or the mashed potatoes will pour out of the holes once they hit the oil. 2) the importance of the rings being frozen 
p15139
aV before entering the oil\u2026it just helps with the frying, that\u2019s all. Finally, since ranch is pretty much good with anything it only seemed natural to pair these savory, fried treats with a quick and easy homemade ranch sauce. Enjoy!

p15205
aV6. Spread the mixture onto a sheet pan, about ½ inch thick and place in the refrigerator until the mixture has cooled down and hardened, 4-6 hours.
p15206
aV7. While the potato mixture cools place both flours, garlic powder, onion powder and smoked paprika into a shallow dish and stir together until fully combined. Set aside.

aV8. When the potato mixture has cooled, remove from the refrigerator and using 1-1 ½ inch circle cutters, cut out as many circles as possible (usually makes about 32-40).
p15208
aV9. Using a ½ inch circle cutter, cut out a ½ inch circle from every 1-1½ circle, creating a small donut shape.

p15212
aV13. While the oil heats up, place the ingredients for the dipping sauce into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Season with salt and pepper.
p15213
aV14. When the oil is hot, carefully drop a few of the rings into the oil and fry for 4-6 minutes or until golden brown.
p15214

aVHi all! So today we have another great edible holiday gift to give out this holiday season. It\u2019s a mix of cheddar and caramel popcorn. This is inspired from this great place called Garrett\u2019s Popcorn in Chicago. They have multiple locations, but it originated in Chicago\u2026as did The Chicago Mix\u2026 The combination might sound weird, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really not. It\u2019s totally awesome. It totally plays on the sweet and salty flavors, with the addition of nutty and cheesy\u2026SO GOOD! I love going home for the holidays and NOT attempting to stop at a location to pick some up. I stick to ordering mine online every year\u2026why? Because lines for Garrett Popcorn Shops are usually at least a block long. No joke. Holidays are the worst too. When I don\u2019t feel like spending $25 on shipping for popcorn I usually go out and buy my own cheddar popcorn, make my own caramel corn and mix \u2018em up. Caramel corn is a lot easier to make than most might think. So try this recipe out because it\u2019s easy, fun, tasty, and you can package it in cute jars and give them out as gifts. Enjoy!

For those of you like me, here\u2019s an awesome dessert recipe that\u2019s also super simple to put together. When the end of summer hits I tend to go on a berry binge and freeze and preserve as many berries possible. This is a great time to take advantage of some of those frozen berries. These mini galettes are great to have in the morning with your coffee or at night, slightly warmed with a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Happy New Years! Now lets start it right by forgetting the diets and baking these awesome sweets, okay?

The rose water cake also goes great with the sweet basic buttercream frosting we\u2019ve paired it with (if you thought our last buttercream frosting recipe was a bit scary with melting sugar and all, you\u2019re sure to like this one. Super easy!). If rose water isn\u2019t your thing it\u2019s no problem at all, just swap it out for another flavoring of your choice. Also, are the glitter raspberries not super awesome?!?!

aV2. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
p15456
aV3. In a stand mixer or with a hand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar for about 3 minutes.
p15457
aV4. With the motor running add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.
p15458
aV5. Add the dry mixture and milk to the butter mixture, alternating in thirds, until all of the dry ingredients and milk have been incorporated. Stir in 1 tablespoon of rose water.
p15459
aV6. Divide the batter between two greased and parchment lined 9 inch cake pans and bake for about 25 minutes or until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of each round.
p15460
aV7. While the cakes bake, make the frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, whip the butter. With the motor running, add the powdered sugar, ½ cup at a time until all of the sugar has been incorporated. Add the milk and vanilla into the mixture and beat until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
p15461
aV8. Allow the cakes to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and place in the refrigerator for about an hour.
p15462
aV9. Once the cakes have chilled, slice each in half so there are a total of four cake layers.
p15463
aV10. In a small bowl stir the remaining rose water into the simple syrup.
p15464
aV11. To assemble: Place a single cake round onto a cake turner (or clean surface) and brush the top with some of the rose water syrup. Add a thin layer of frosting over the syrup and top with another layer of cake.
p15465
aV12. Repeat step 11 until all of the layers have been used. Coat the cake in a thin layer of frosting to create a crumb coat and allow the cake to chill for 30 minutes.
p15466
aV13. Decorate cake with the remaining frosting and begin to dust cake with gold luster dust. (I find the easiest way to completely coat the cake in luster dust is to dab some onto a pastry brush, pull the bristles back with my fingers and flick it towards the cake)

aV14. Roll raspberries in luster dust until well coated and arrange on top of the cake. Serve.

aVAfter taking the leap and getting my own studio this year, I am slowly organizing it so it can be both kinda pretty and functional. I am still working on the dish organization part, and moving stuff around, getting stuff built. Its actually kind of a pain, but I still love it. I think in a couple of months we might do a little behind the scenes post so you can see where we work most of the time, the excessive plate buying problem I have, and maybe you can meet some of the cute cats that run around the hallways of the lofts where my studio is at. I think that would be fun. I wish I could also see all the workplaces where you all spend your time. I am always so curious, where you all read our blog from, and what it looks like around you. If you want to post some pictures of your neat workspace on our facebook, you should, because I think that would be fun. Then it will be like we are trading pictures. Thats kinda cute.

aVHi All! So I know I say it all the time, but\u2026..I don\u2019t have a sweet tooth. I really wish I had one, but I just don\u2019t. I love making sweets, but could totally care less about eating them. Maybe it\u2019s because my mom was never a \u201cbaker\u201d so to say while my sister and I grew up. Maybe it\u2019s because sometimes my parents and I tend to order a few appetizers to share after a big meal instead of a dessert or two to split (true story). Or maybe it\u2019s just the way I was hardwired, I don\u2019t know. In my mind a piece of cake will never look as appetizing as a cheeseburger, I\u2019ll always walk away from a cream puff, to indulge in a pate and cheese plate and saying no to ice cream is no big, while short-ribs? Impossible.
p15580
aVThere\u2019s one exception to this\u2026.Nutella. What is it about this stuff that get people (including me) so excited? I think it\u2019s the chocolate-hazelnut flavors and the smooth, rich texture. I also think it\u2019s because it reminds me of \u201cYan-Yans\u201d. PLEASE tell me somebody know what I\u2019m talking about? Those toasty, sort of sweet, bready sticks that are served along side a small amount of chocolate or strawberry\u2026not even sauce but frosting! These things are awesome\u2026but I digress.
p15581
aVBack to Nutella\u2026it\u2019s great; today we have an awesome and super simple salted Nutella tart recipe for you all. I added a touch of sea salt and topped it with a light whipped cream to offset the super decadent Nutella. Oh and lets not forget the super buttery and nutty crust! I used almonds because it\u2019s what I had on hand, but you could replace I with hazelnuts if you prefer. Enjoy!

aVIt\u2019s Friday\u2026yay!  So I know I said that we would be jumping into our Super Bowl fry fest next week, but we got a little excited and couldn\u2019t resist starting a little early\u2026.enter baby chimichangas. These little beauties are pretty great; small pockets of fried goodness with a creamy Sriracha-lime dipping sauce. Why are these chimichangas so special? Two reasons: 1) You can actually taste the filling! It\u2019s not just a piece of fried flour tortilla which I\u2019ve often feel I\u2019ve been served when ordering chimichangas. 2) They\u2019re little and cute; and the rule is that the smaller the food is, the more you can eat. Well, that\u2019s my rule as least :)
p15659
aVThese little guys are filled with large chunks of chicken, diced poblanos, fresh corn, sharp cheddar\u2026yea, they\u2019re awesome me thinks. You can make this quick and easy recipe even faster by buying a roasted chicken and shredding it up. Just a thought :) So as everyone gets their menus together for \u201cBinge Eating Day\u201d (lets be serious, most of us care about the food way more then the \u201cbig game\u201d) I urge you all to stick these on your menu this year. You won\u2019t regret it\u2026..I promise!

More on that in due time. We are getting kinda grumpy, and kinda wanting to have drinks at noon and lay on bubble wrap on the floor of the studio instead of working. Its almost over, and I am super excited when this month is long gone. It makes you think though, about how lucky we both are that we are doing a job we love, even though we think that sometimes it sucks. Anyway, I\u2019m going to Seattle this week, and I want to ask you guys, if you know of anywhere awesome to buy some cool plates and linens. I\u2019m not talking about Crate and Barrel stuff, I\u2019m talking about local ceramicists and neat stores. I will also super appreciate food recommendations. Thank you in advance. :) Now, back to the food. I don\u2019t really have much to say about this dish because you probably already know its delicious. But what I will say is that I eat this when I feel fat. It has like a built in magic trick to make you feel full, but not \u2018fat\u2019 full. If that makes any sense. So if any of you are feeling like fatties out there, you should try this Tuna Tartare with Belgian Endive Leaves. :)

VHi. Hi. I wanted to thank everyone who left a comment and told me awesome places to go in Seattle. It was fun, and not too cold. I sometimes had a fourth meal. One day I walked around town with the top button of my pants undone. Intentionally, for extra room purposes. It was overall really great. I have never eaten so many oysters in my life. So thanks everyone for leaving me helpful comments! You made my trip better!

VHi All! We\u2019re ending \u201cDeep-Fry Fest\u201d week over at SFB and leaving you all with this gem of a recipe\u2026.Korean.Fried.Chicken. It\u2019s a fun take on the classic buffalo wings that everyone seems to love oh so much (rightfully so)\u2026especially for the super bowl. If you love wings you\u2019ll love this simple and AWESOME take on fried chicken. You would think that battering the wings before frying would leave you with oily and heavy fried chicken, but it\u2019s totally not true\u2026it\u2019s the opposite. The batter actually helps make the chicken super light and extra crispy\u2026crunchy is probably a better word\u2026but not like gross crunchy\u2026just super crisp. You know crunchy sound effects they use on tv? I bet they use Korean fried chicken to make that crunchy food sound effect\u2026Are you all getting that this is super crisp chicken? Have I beaten that into your heads enough? Just a little? :)

aVI\u2019m kind of a pickle hater. I really only like them when its relish. So these were interesting for me. Let me tell you though, these are good. Even for non pickle fans. They are SUPER crispy, and easy to make, and delicious. The bleu cheese in my opinion is the best part. You should make them for Superbowl. Duh. This is why this week we are just posting artery clogging food. Then next week, we can all go to us magazine and search for the latest celebrity liquid cleanse (just kidding). Ok, so yay football, yay fried foods. Go Lakers! (bad joke, I know)

aVHi. I hope you all had a nice Valentines day. I did. I went to eat at a place in Hollywood, you know the places with prix fixe menu. So you basically get decisions forced upon you. It was nice though. At dessert the dude at the table next to us began to eat part of the \u201cdessert for two,\u201d and in a perfect moment, where our conversation had a pause, and the music stopped, we overhead him loudly exclaim that it tasted like diapers. We burst into laughter. He tried to save his comment by then explaining he used to change his nephews diapers. It didn\u2019t work. In case you were wondering, yes, somehow the panna cotta we got served totally tasted like diapers. I\u2019m not sure what they were going for, but it wasn\u2019t good.
p15933
aVSo now that we are done with fried foods, and valentines foods, we thought we would start with this light Edamame dip that is paired with Japanese Crackers. It makes a really great snack. You could also just prepare the Edamame Dip and use it as a simple spread on toast, or anything really. Enjoy!

aVDid you all have a good super bowl or puppy bowl? Madonna is scary, no? I\u2019ve been seeing pictures of her from the Super Bowl, and it literally scares me. Nightmare scary. Anyway, asparagus fries are actually pretty neat. They are surprisingly crispy. Asparagus is one of my favorite green things to eat, and this is a new way I have never had them before. Pretty good. These would also make a good side dish. The trio of sauces you can serve with them are pretty bomb. My favorite thing about these are the little asparagus spear tops. Super cute.

The carrot, daikon, and cucumber make it feel less heavy and glutinous. The neat thing about these is that you can make a bunch and have them for dinner, or you could totally just make one big one and eat it yourself. P.S. The marinade for this is awesome. Awesome sauce.

Sometimes I want pizza, and potatoes, and a marinara dipping sauce, and I don\u2019t want to get all up in my kitchens business to have it. Don\u2019t judge.

One of my favorite things about the about the trip was the fact that everywhere I turned there were Conch Fritters (one of my best memories on the trip involved food, go figure). When I first saw them I was skeptical, thinking that I would be biting into a mouthful of greasy, bready batter. Nope, not at all! They were light, crisp and filled with chopped conch (think humungous clam of sorts, in more of a \u201csnaily\u201d type shell). I think I had a fritter with every meal while I was there, super good!

aVI have this problem, where whenever I hear the words peanut butter, I think of this song I used to sing as a kid. It makes me so mad, because usually I end up singing this song in my head for awhile. I can never get it out!!!! While searching the internet for this lovely song, I cam across this super annoying video. This is probably the most obnoxious video I have seen in a long time so I recommend watching like 5 seconds of it, or just not at all. 
p16399
aV you go. Ok, but the REAL video, the video of the song I think about is 
p16400
aVI picked this one because it is sufficiently awkward, and the way the man carrying the camera says jelly is funny. Truth, its still an annoying video and I won\u2019t hate you if you don\u2019t watch it. So, Creamy Peanut Butter Pies, that is what we have today. Super easy, and really freaking good, especially if you like peanut butter. The peanut butter is crazy creamy, and light and fluffy. I hope you all have a great weekend, and eat lots of good food.

aVHi All! Guess what? I\u2019m a procrastinator\u2026big time. For example, today\u2019s post\u2026.I was supposed to write this last night, but didn\u2019t. Now, I\u2019m feverishly writing away trying to finish before Teri gets in this morning for our shoot today! Also, if you were to look at my iphone, you\u2019d notice the screen is completely cracked\u2026usable, but cracked. This happened about 2 months ago\u2026.but I\u2019ve been procrastinating getting it fixed. Well that\u2019s also partly due to my laziness, but that a whole other subject. Anyway, who cares if I\u2019ll be cursing at myself later for watching 2 HOURS of reality

aV television instead of getting my laundry done (ugh) or getting the haircut I\u2019ve been putting off for 6 months!! (gross, I know). Will I ever grow out of this?! Probably not, but I\u2019m okay with it and I can openly admit: I Procrastinate and I\u2019m [not so] proud of it!
p16482
aVNow to food, today we have something that I never put off making if I say I\u2019m going to do it: Root vegetable fritters! They\u2019re so tasty, easy to make and the parsnip adds a hint of unexpected sweetness (in totally a good way) to the fritters! They\u2019re also a great inexpensive and super easy appetizer or side dish to any meal! Make \u2018em, please?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVHi! We have these neat little Moroccan cookies for you today, Chebakia. These cookies are similar to a number of Korean desserts because they\u2019re not incredibly sweet and have a strong sesame taste to them. Many korean sweets are sesame and honey based or studded in sesame seeds and this Moroccan cookie is super similar to a few different Korean sweets such as Yakgwa and Hangwa. We\u2019ve changed this traditional little dessert up by dipping the cookies in a mix of honey and homemade ginger syrup, rather than the typical honey and orange blossom water combo. We\u2019ve also replaced the almonds for hazelnuts which does change the flavor quite a bit (pine nuts work great too!). These fried cookies are pretty easy to make (don\u2019t be intimidated by the shaping technique) and great to enjoy with a cup of coffee or a mild tea. Surprise your guests with Chebakia: Moroccan Sesame Spice Cookies for a unique little after dinner treat or add these to your next weekend brunch menu!

aV3. Place mixture into a large mixing bowl. Add flour, cinnamon, cardamom, anise seed, coriander, baking powder, and salt and whisk together.
p16624
aV4. Pour water in a small bowl and top with saffron and yeast. Allow yeast mixture to sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
p16625
aV5. Pour yeast mixture into dry mixture along with remaining dough ingredients. Stir together until dough forms. (if dough is dry add water, 1 tablespoon at a time)
p16626
aV6. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth and slightly elastic dough forms, about 6 to 8 minutes.
p16627
aV7. Place dough into a mixing bowl and cover with a clean, damp towel. Set aside and allow to rest, about 20 minutes.
p16628
aV8. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch thick.
p16629
aV9. For cookies: Cut out 3\u201dx 3\u201d squares (using a fluted pasta cutter, if desired), adding four evenly spaced 1\u201d slits across each square.
p16630
aV10. Take one of the prepared squares and weave the slits through your pointer finger. Take the corners closest to the tip of your finger and pinch them together. Slow pull your finger out of the slits while pulling the pinched end through the center, coming out the other end. Gently open up each side and gently press together. Set aside and repeat until all squares have been shaped.
p16631
aV11. Fry each cookie in the oil, a few at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels and repeat until all cookies have been fried. Set aside and allow to cool.

VNotice a common theme in my summer \u201cbucket list\u201d? Yea, I plan on spending most of my free time down by the beach. Picnicking on the beach is also something I love to do. When I pack a meal for a beach picnic I like to pack things that transport well, that aren\u2019t completely temperature sensitive and that can also be considered \u201csnacky\u201d. These Korean-Style Cocktail Meatballs are something I love packing on picnics as well as bringing as hors\u2019dourves to any cocktail party. They\u2019re bite sized, filled with tons of great flavor and have a unique twist to them with the gochujang glaze. You can adjust the spiciness in the glaze by scaling down on the chile paste and adding more sugar as needed. This is a great little cocktail treat that\u2019s really easy to whip together and bring to a party, or just pack them up and enjoy them with someone special!

aVHi Guys! Today we have some little Italian cookies for you, called Baci Di Dama, literally translating to \u201cLady Kisses\u201d. People all them this because they tend to look like dainty little pairs of lips, cute right? They also kind of resemble two people kissing, the way they\u2019re all sandwiched together\u2026again, precious. These cookies might originate from the Piemonte region of Italy, but you can really find them all over the country. I had these little cookies specifically when I was in Florence, although they were filled with a hazelnut flavored chocolate and made using almond meal/flour. Since sweet chestnuts are so common in Florence, and my only memory of these cookies are from that city, I decided to make these little cookies with a 50/50 blend of all purpose flour and chestnut flour. The chestnut flour works great in this recipe and totally imparts a lovely and slightly unique [chest]nuttiness to the cookies. Can\u2019t find chestnut flour or don\u2019t want to order it online? Not a problem, 100% all purpose works just fine, although you\u2019ll lose the chestnut flavor and the texture of the cookies will be slightly more \u201cbiscuit\u201d like. These are great with coffee and tea, but my favorite is serving them as apart of a mix dessert platter with tall glasses of champagne. Yum! These little cookies are tasty, super cute and really easy to make\u2026so do it! ) Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVHey Guys! When I was growing up cereals like shredded wheat wasn\u2019t something we ate\u2026.ever. Nor did we do, super healthy, super low in sugar, organic granola, or even steamy hot oatmeal with a sprinkle of brown sugar, diced apples, etc. (and fyi, to this very day I totally hate the stuff\u2026.yep, \u2018tis true). For breakfast, my family and I ate things like spicy tofu soup, oxtail soup, rice and kimchi, rice porridge, this is just how I grew up!\u2026but I digress. Something we did always seem to have around for a quick and easy \u201cbreakfast\u201d was super sugary Cinnamon Toast Crunch\u2026.and Corn Pops and Rice Krispies and Cap\u2019n Crunch \u2026but Cinnamon Toast Crunch was by far my absolute favorite! I always felt like I was eating a cinnamon roll when eating a bowl of this cereal\u2026.and whenever I\u2019d get to the bottom of the bowl, I was always more than happy to suck down the remaining cinnamon-sugar milk. So Good!
p16876
aVAnyway, I thought it would be fun to create sort of a throwback to one of my favorite childhood cereals, so today we have \u201cCinnamon Toast Crunch Coffee Cake Bites\u201d. I wanted to stay in the realm of sweet breakfasts and bite-sized anythings, because small is awesome! If you\u2019re worried about the bites themselves sticking to the muffin tin, then go ahead and use mini liners and peel them off the bites once they cool before turning them upside down and glazing them. These are really great with or without the streusel center, so it\u2019s really up to you; the streusel helps to incorporate the actual cereal into the recipe more as well as imparts a great flavor and texture.   I hope you guys make a batch of these this weekend while thinking about your favorite sugary cereal growing up\u2026.and those cheesy commercials! xx, Jenny

I do\u2026and I also remember despite facials, mani/pedi\u2019s and trying to \u201crejuvenate\u201d our 13 year old selves there was A LOT of junk food around: pizza, pop, cookies, bin candy, potato chips, and that fake, weird, terrible for you yet embarrassingly delicious jar of French onion dip. I\u2019m not quite sure what it was about that dip, but that magical sauce made it to almost all of my tween sleepovers. These days, I\u2019m not much into creamy dips like that (except for artichoke dip\u2026.that one will always have me heart)\u2026I\u2019m not sure why, I\u2019m just not. What I am totally into is this version of one of my childhood favorite dips, made healthier. I\u2019m really into using Greek yogurt to sub mayonnaise or sour cream as often as I can and although there is still some sour cream in there to give the dip a smoother texture, it\u2019s mostly Greek yogurt\u2026.I really heart Greek yogurt\u2026.and this dip.
p16960
aVIf you are willing to brave a hot kitchen for about an hour (woof, I know), this dip is totally worth it and a delicious treat to help keep you cool (once you\u2019re sitting and enjoying it) and leave you feeling guilt-less afterwards! Hope everyone\u2019s keeping cool! Enjoy

I have to admit, I hadn\u2019t actually tasted my first strawberry shortcake until culinary school, about 4 years ago\u2026I know\u2026.BUT I did grow up obsessed with the books, especially the scented ones that were also plastic with a sponge lining so you could take the book into the bath with you to smell and read it, which I now think are a little weird/creepy or maybe I\u2019ve just been watching too much Law and Order: SVU lately\u2026.I digress.

Today I\u2019ve replaced my egg and milk for Greek yogurt AND just like in regular shortcake recipes the amount of sugar in the whole batch is pretty low\u2026.yay, for sorta healthier cookies! :)

aVHi Guys! Do any of you have weird childhood snacks that have stuck with you all these years? I do. When my sister and I were little we were (and still sort of are) obsessed with Yan-Yans; her with the strawberry and me with chocolate, always and always. Every time we went to the Asian market with our mom, we knew we\u2019d each be walking out of the store holding a container of yan-yans\u2026oh the good old days. :) If you know what yan-yans are you\u2019re cool and I like you\u2026.if you don\u2019t, its okay\u2026just think \u201cdunkaroos\u201d but replace the kangaroo cookies with yummy biscuit sticks and add two more frosting flavors and mulitple the awesomeness by 20. That\u2019s it.
p17150
aVAnyway, yan-yans are totally awesome and these homemade versions are super simple to make! I should warn that each frosting recipe makes quite a lot of frosting so you may want to scale back on each or just make one flavor. The consistency is thinner than regular frosting to make the sticks easy to dip, but you could always thicken it up with a bit more powdered sugar and have some really great strawberry, chocolate and vanilla-bean frostings for your baked goods too! Oh yan-yans, I love you\u2026and I totally hope you all love them too! xx Jenny

aVI went home this past weekend to Boise for my cousins wedding. Going back home for me is always a struggle. The internet is reeeaaallllyyy slow there. You can\u2019t eat any kind of food you want whenever you want. Everything is closed on Sundays, and when it gets really hot there, I sweat in places I don\u2019t want to talk about. Once I hop on the plane back to LA, I then start to realize all the awesome things about Boise. Friends, family, rivers, camping, stars, and thrift stores. Things that I want to do more of in and around LA, but I am just not sure how. Do any of you LA people have some awesome summer activities you want to share? :)

aVToday we have this amazing delicious recipe. I feel like everything is the form of nuggets is good. These are no exception. Chicken frying them makes them really crispy, but the inside still stays juicy and yummy. We also gave you two sauces to dip with. Honey Mustard, and Grilled Banana Ketchup from a post last week. If you missed it, go see it and try it. It\u2019s soooooo good.

V1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
p17405
aV2. For crust: Place flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder into a food processor and pulse together. Add cream cheese and butter and pulse until a fine mealy texture has been formed. Add the water and vinegar and pulse until a dough forms. Form dough into a disc and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for an hour. Roll dough onto a lightly floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut 24, 2 inch squares from the dough and form into 1 inch tart molds, trimming the edges of excess dough as needed. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
p17406
aV3. For the filling: Place all ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir together until fully combined. Pour mixture into prepared shells and completely fill.
p17407
aV4. Bake mini pies for 10 minutes. Lower temperature to 350°F and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until the pies have set in the center and the crusts are golden brown. Allow to cool for about an hour before topping each with a dollop of whipped cream and serving.
p17408
aV1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease two mini muffin tins and set aside.
p17409
aV2. In a medium mixing bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, all-spice, and salt. Set aside.
p17410
aV3. In another mixing bowl combine oil and sugars and whisk together. Add eggs and vanilla and continue to whisk together.
p17411
aV4. In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, orange zest and juice.
p17412
aV5. Alternately add dry mixture and yogurt mixture to sugar mixture, in thirds until fully incorporated. Fill each muffin tin 2/3 way and bake for 20 to 25 minute or until a toothpick come out clean when inserted into the center of the cakes. Allow cakes to cool before removing cakes from tin and flip each over some they\u2019re standing top down.
p17413
aV6. For the glaze: In a small bowl stir together the pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add powdered sugar and stir until fully incorporated (using a fork over a whisk is recommended to avoid air bubbles).
p17414
aV7. To assemble: Pour about 1 teaspoon of the pumpkin glaze over each orange-spice cake and finish with a sprinkle of pistachios. Allow glaze to set before serving.
p17415
aV1. Place ice cream, pie, milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a blender and blend until smooth.

aVWe all know that with the holiday season comes parties and parties and fake smiling, and makeup, and high heels, and food. So some things are about holidays are awesome, and some things about holidays are not. On the good side, I would put all the delicious food you get to eat, and make. These little tartlets are just for those times. You know when you make cookies, you eat the dough? Or when you make frosting, you lick the spoon? So while you\u2019re assembling these I suggest you take a slice of pear and top it with some cheese and maybe even some of the port reduction. It will be a good snack for you while you wait for these to get out of the oven. These are seriously so yummy, and very pretty. The marriage of the flavors is really perfect, and it is so easy to make. Consider it for your next party. Also, just so you remember, we have a TON of appetizer foods in our recipe index if you\u2019re in the market!

Lately when I\u2019ve been feeling stressed I\u2019ve been doing the worst thing possible\u2026stress eating!! I try to keep it healthy when I stress eat, but that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes to calm my nerves I make fancy snacks to eat at home, like this yellowtail crudo! There\u2019s just something about making these super simple, yet slightly elevated dishes that make me very happy. What can I say, it\u2019s the little things. :) This is similar to our 
p17542
aV with uni and scallops in that it is much less expensive to make this dish at home and it\u2019s quick and easy.
p17543
aVI love the creaminess of yellowtail and love pairing it with bold flavors and textures like tart pomegranate and bitter/crisp radishes. The shiso oil in this dish makes it really special, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with making your own, I light drizzle of a flavorful olive oil is just fine. During this crazy holiday time, I recommend you throw in a dish like this here and there for one of the many holiday parties we will all be throwing/attending. It\u2019s a yummy and unexpected dish that will fill you up, but not leave you feeling heavy and gross. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVWe are cheese and meat fiends. We could both live on eating off cheeseboards and be totally happy. So we wanted to show you what we think makes up a quick and easy cheese board. We also did some really fun quick and easy little DIY stuff with some 
p17591
aV. So let\u2019s jump into what makes our tablescape neat. We poured some 
p17592
aV into some clear glass ornaments and strung them with some pinecones to create some really simple garland that you could hang anywhere (you could also use scented pinecones, they smell amazing). We also took some old mason jars we had hanging around that painted the inside of them and then used them as vases. We painted some wood blocks we picked up at the hardware store to use on our table to give things some height. Super simple stuff. We paired with 
p17593
aV for this project because they have this really awesome program going on. It\u2019s called
p17594
aV. Basically, they know that choosing the right paint is scary, so they guarantee that you love your color you choose, and if you don\u2019t they will give you a new one. Simple, awesome, stress free color picking. Yay! The 
p17595
aV Guarantee runs through October 7, 2013, so if you\u2019re thinking about painting a room, do it before then!
p17596
aVWe all know that this time of year can get super crazy so why not also give yourself a break and forget the long, low and slow braises or fussy put together apps. We think an awesome cheese board (and lots of wine!) is all you need for your next holiday or cocktail party. When we say cheese board we don\u2019t mean one of those pre-made cheddar cheese, ham and Ritz cracker platters with plastic tops (although we have happily noshed on a handful of those in the past), we mean head out to your local cheese shop or even grocery store and see what they have! We like mixing our meats and cheeses up and giving our guests variety. Along with the charcuterie and cheese you want to give your guests cheese board \u201cfixin\u2019s\u201d such as a nuts (we made some maple cinnamon pecans for the holiday season), fruit whether dried or fresh (in the grape, apple, pear variety), honey for an extra touch of sweetness, and finally some nice crostini to pile everything else onto before shoving it in your mouths\u2026 We definitely had a field day eating this spread up! Super basic, super good. Enjoy, everyone!
p17597
aVSide Note: We hope you\u2019re excited because once the new year hits we are going to present you all with a detailed run down of our own ideal charcuterie and cheese spread, and it\u2019s pretty cray! Told ya we love meat n\u2019 cheese. :)

aVHappy Wednesday! I hope everyone had a very filling Thanksgiving. I am super pumped about Christmas / Holiday season. I am the person who gets the Christmas stuff out the day after Thanksgiving, and I get really excited when I see ornaments at Rite Aid. Then you know it\u2019s all really happening. This year, we are going to really bring it with some yummy cookie recipes for you guys, as well as some gift giving make your own \u2013 do it yourself- situations. So get ready. First up are these Chocolate Chip Rice Krispies Treat Cookies. Like most of you, I am a really big fan of rice krispies treats. So making them into cookies with chocolate was kinda a no brainer. Super yum. The rice krispies make the cookies amazingly chewy, and the chunks of marshmallow and chocolate are awesome little flavor pockets as you eat your way through. Hope you all enjoy!

aVHi Guys! After reading many of your comments about the cookies turning into nut lace sitches, I went back and figured out the issue. I added way to much butter to flour when I typed this up. The new recipe should yield 3 dozen, non-nut lace cookies. :) They still spread, so beware of that, but not as much and they\u2019re great! Sorry for the blooper and thanks for your patience, everyone! xx, Jenny

aVHey guys! So I think I should clarify something\u2026.. I don\u2019t hate Valentine\u2019s Day. Really. After Monday\u2019s post a friend of mine called me to ask if everything was okay with the boyfriend and I\u2026.when I told her \u201cyes! \u201c and asked why, she said it\u2019s because it seemed like I was hating on V-day in my last post. I chuckled. So here\u2019s a little clarification. I don\u2019t hate Valentine\u2019s Day. I think it\u2019s a cute, albeit fake, holiday! My issue isn\u2019t about the day itself, celebrating love, etc.; my issue is all the pressure it seems to put on people/couples to go hard and celebrate in the biggest way possible. If that\u2019s what you and your partner want to do\u2026GREAT! I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, that\u2019s all\u2026just do what ya feel like doin\u2019, that\u2019s all. :)
p17690
aVNow to these little \u201cDeviled Hearts\u201d\u2026no bake cheesecake stuffed strawberries are nothing new. Totally delicious, but nothing new. We\u2019re adding our own twist to this yummy dessert, by splitting them down the middle, scooping out the centers and piping the filling straight into them\u2026.\u201dDeviled Hearts\u201d\u2026get it?! Just like the panna cotta from Monday, this dessert is SUPER easy (seriously takes 15 minutes, tops) and REALLY addicting. I actually made a very similar recipe for a upcoming issue of a popular food magazine (more on that as the issue approaches!) and when testing these\u2026lets just say the boyfriend (aka, the taste tester) down 16 of them in one sitting\u2026.16! I also made these for the super bowl, but as a dip sitch and as soon as I set the platter out, people were huddling around it until they were gone\u2026.so I think we have a winner here! I\u2019ve made these \u201cNew York Style\u201d by adding a good amount of sour cream and lemon zest (I just love the tang). Folding the whipped cream into the mixture is key as it\u2019ll give you a light and fluffy filling! If you\u2019re looking for a last minute V-Day dessert\u2026I recommend these! They\u2019re a cute V-day dessert, but you can really make them for any occasion! I hope everyone has a fun and safe Valentine\u2019s Day, doing whatever the heck y\u2019all want! ;) xx, Jenny

It\u2019s a tiny mountain town close to Temecula and Palm Springs (think Big Bear scaled down a lot and minus the snow boarding) and can I just say, I\u2019m totally in love! It really is a teeny-tiny town filled with gorgeous, scenic hiking trails and cute snow capped mountains. It was just a quick 2 hour drive inland and we stayed in a private two-story cottage with Strawberry creek just a stones throw away from our back patio. Needless to say I was in my happy place, doing my happy dance ALL.WEEKEND.LONG.

p17832
aVsugar coating:
p17833
aV1/2 cup granulated sugar
p17834
aV2/3 cup powdered sugar
p17835
aVDirections:
p17836
aV1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
p17837
aV2. In a double boiler over medium heat melt chocolates and butter together until smooth. Stir in coffee, cinnamon, cayenne, and chile powder and stir until fully incorporated. Set aside and allow chocolate mixture to cool slightly.
p17838
aV3. While chocolate mixture melts, combine almond meal, flour, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Set aside.
p17839
aV4. Place the eggs and sugar into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or in a mixing bowl with a hand mixer and mix until the mixture has thickened and become a pale yellow color, 5 to 6 minutes.
p17840
aV5. With the motor running, begin pouring the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, in a slow and steady stream (to prevent curdling) until fully incorporated.
p17841
aV6. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the flour mixture until fully incorporated. Pour the batter into a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap (at this point the mixture will be loose).
p17842
aV7. Allow mixture to chill for at least 3 hours before using.
p17843
aV8. Once mixture has chilled, use a cookie scooper to scoop out 1 tablespoon sized balls.
p17844
aV9. Quickly roll them in the granulated sugar, followed by the powdered sugar until fully covered and place the on a parchment lined baking sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart, the cookies will spread (Tip: try to handle the \u201ccookie dough\u201d as little as possible and with cold hands, as they have a similar consistency to ganache and will melt in your hands quickly)
p17845
aV10. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the cookies have spread, leaving a fun \u201cearthquake\u201d effect on the tops of the cookies. Allow the cookies to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They should be slightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

aVHi guys! Were any of you girl scouts? boy scouts? I was a girl scout for one year, 4th grade. Troop 428. There was one and only one reason I wanted to join girl scouts\u2026.the outfits. I was totally obsessed with the knee socks, the skirts, even the vest and sash\u2026.I wanted it ALL. My mom decided she would humor my girl scout clothing obsession by letting me join one year, with the exception that I was going to learn the true meaning of being a girl scout, etc, etc\u2026..such a good mom thing to say.
p17853
aVAnyway, that day magical came\u2026I was FINALLY going to pick out and being sporting my cute new outfit everywhere. I could barely contain myself, I was freaking out. I ran into the store and suddenly it was like the blackest cloud sailed over me\u2026.where were the knee socks? the skirts?\u2026.and why was there so much FLORAL PRINTED CLOTHING EVERYWHERE??? That year the girl scouts decided to \u201ctry something new\u201d to \u201cupdate their look\u201d by introducing a new line of clothes that consisted of floral leggings, green sweatshirts with \u201cGirl Scouts\u201d printed on them in floral and white t-shirts with the same print. Needless to say I could feel my cheeks getting hot and the tears welding up in my eyes. I tried as hard as I could to hold them back, because man was I going to look like a spoiled brat, crying over the new girl scouts outfits\u2026.but I couldn\u2019t help it. I sadly picked out everything I needed and dragged my feet back to the car.
p17854
aVI wish I could say that my experience in girl scouts totally made up for my traumatic experience, but it didn\u2019t. My group leaders were not into it at all, making it not fun for us kids. We really didn\u2019t do much of anything except sit in small groups and talk about our day\u2026.while dressed in floral printed sweats. The philanthropic aspect of it seemed to escape us as well. We didn\u2019t really receive any guidance from our leaders about the badges, which was really weird. Now I\u2019m totally not knocking girl/boy scouts, I think overall it\u2019s a really great program for young kids and I have many friends who were girl scouts and friends who were boy scouts and absolutely LOVED IT!\u2026\u2026I just had quite an interesting experience.
p17855
aVOne of the best things about girl scouts, doesn\u2019t matter who you are, are the cookies\u2026no doubt! Who doesn\u2019t freak out in excitement when you see those little girls standing out in front of grocery stores, just waiting to take all your money?! It\u2019s just a bummer that you can\u2019t get them year round\u2026well I guess you can e-bay them and stuff, but that\u2019s a little intense even for me. This year we\u2019ve solved the problem of not being able to have girl scout cookies all year long, by making homemade versions of three of our favorite kinds! Yep, that\u2019s right\u2026we have them for you! Just a fair warning that while these are easy cookie recipes, the assembly does take a little bit of work\u2026especially the caramel delight cookies\u2026but trust me, they\u2019re totally worth it! Maybe stick a few of these in a holiday gift pack for friends, family or co-workers? They\u2019ll love ya for it\u2026promise! xx, Jenny

VSometimes the world becomes an exhausting place to exist. Sometimes it seems like everything is not on your side, and things are just not going your way. Like when you\u2019re in the middle of a really good episode of West Wing and your Netflix stops buffering and then it tells you the show is unavailable. Or when your cheap landlord blames a broken sink handle on you when its really because the sink has probably been there since 1923. Or when your landlord then asks you if you\u2019re expecting because you are wearing a baggy shirt and unattractive sweats. That\u2019s cool. That\u2019s fun, and that is life. Sometimes though, when life gives you lemons, you just want to hurl them with everything you\u2019ve got at your landlords face, because you know what? I don\u2019t feel like making lemonade. Sometimes, when life happens, you have to make something delicious so that you yourself can eat it all, and not give any to anyone else. Sometimes for me, those little gifts of deliciousness are something savory, and sometimes they are really effing cute, and puffy, and perfectly sized so I can eat like a million. Sometimes those little \u2018make it all ok\u2019 treats are these Sun Dried Tomato Olive & Goat Cheese Palmiers. When life happens, eat cute things. It\u2019s my new motto.

aVHey Guys! Teri and I took ourselves a bit of a \u201cwinter break\u201d from the blog, but now we\u2019re back with some neat recipes to share with you all! We\u2019re trying our best to start this year off right by staying active and filling our bodies up with delicious, health(ier) foods. So that brings us to today\u2019s recipe. I must say I have a bit of a weakness for oober creamy spinach and artichoke dip and love snacking on the stuff, hot or cold. It\u2019s such a great comfort food for me and when I\u2019m nibbling away I usually feel like 
p18009
aV. Unfortunately I can feel my thighs grow the second the dip hits my lips, so this kale and artichoke dip is my healthier version of spinach and artichoke dip. It\u2019s a cold version of the dip that I make with nonfat Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and cream cheese and bulked up with sauteed kale and shallots, instead of spinach, although you could always stick with spinach if that\u2019s what you prefer. Not only are we starting the year with a delicious and healthier recipe, but we\u2019re also hosting a giveaway! Check the details out below! I hope everyone has started their 2013 with a nice, fresh and healthy start! Enjoy!

VHi Guys! So two nights ago I was lucky enough to see Anthony Bourdain and Roy Choi speak at the Pantages in LA. Did anyone else go? and did anyone else have the best time listening to the ever articulate and brilliant Tony Bourdain and totally awesome and badass Chef Choi?! I loved it! It\u2019s always so refreshing to see and hear two people you look up to so much, pretty much just shooting the shit for 2 hours on stage. Even the audience q&a (which normally I HATE bc man, people can ask some really mundane and self-involved questions and it really sucks sometimes) was really fun and interesting\u2026some people asked really great questions! It was also no matter that I was on a shoot earlier that day that ended up over 50 miles away from the theater! Luckily, the boyfriend was meeting me at the theater bc of the time, bc he probably would\u2019ve had a heart attack in the car with me. I may have been dangerously weaving through cars and I may have been blazing down the freeway much faster than I should be going\u2026.but absolutely nothing was going to keep me from attending an event with my boyfriend\u2026. to watch my other two boyfriends, Tony and Roy, speak. :)
p18097
aVSome of you may know this, some of you may not, but Roy Choi is my current favorite chef. Yes, I\u2019m a little bias because part of my love, for both him (and David Chang for that matter) does stem from the fact that he is an outstanding and creative Korean-American chef, but more so because of the way Chef Choi looks at food and different places he finds his day to day inspiration. I love that he once wrote in an interview how he had an epiphany about how his whole culinary career is based off his obsession with milkshakes! 
p18098
aV (quote source from firstwefeast.com) How awesome is that?!?!
p18099
aVIn the recent (well for the last year) Chef Choi has gone vegetarian in a sense (still eats meat in dishes offered to him, presented to him, but hasn\u2019t ordered a meat dish in about a year) and when it first came out he was highly criticized for turning him back on something that made him oober successful \u201ckogi\u201d, which translates to \u201cmeat\u201d. You know what I say to the nay sayers? Get off his back! (see my creepy obsession starting to build?) He\u2019s not turning his back on meat or his successful food trucks as well as his booming restaurants; he\u2019s simply made a personal decision for himself and i\u2019m excited. Why? In my mind, a true chef isn\u2019t measured by the best savory, rich meat dish he/she can make (bc lets be serious, if we all used bacon fat, duck fat, etc in our cooking, everyone\u2019s food would taste amazing), but by the best salad/side dish they can make. No joke. I think it\u2019s much more difficult to push a salad than it is to push roasted bone marrow with buttery toast points or a pappardelle and short rib ragu.
p18100
aVSo in honor of Chef Choi and his new found love of veggies we have not a salad for you today, lol, but simple and delicious blistered shishito peppers. I love these things and I love them blistered. I\u2019ve started to see them as small appetizers around a few LA restaurants and that\u2019s exciting. Shishito peppers are a sweeter variety of Japanese peppers with a neat \u201ctwisted-like\u201d shape. When you blister them, (either on a grill or in a cast iron skillet), they get a really nice smokey aroma to them and soften just the right amount. For these peppers, I like keeping things super simple and let the peppers speak for themselves. Nothing but a little sesame oil, salt and pepper. Yum-town. Not only is this snack delicious and easily transportable (mid afternoon work snack? Yes, please), but it\u2019s seriously a 10 minute recipe from start to finish. I\u2019m pretty sure these are going to be my new go to healthy snack and hopefully they\u2019re Roy Choi approved. :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VI went to Portland this weekend for quick 1.5 day trip. A total surprise to me, and it was kind of in celebration of my birthday. I really don\u2019t like getting super really scary close to 30 in age, so birthdays now have just become a date to look forward to and be depressed about. Anyway, obviously in Portland I just ate a lot of food, felt really overly full and tried to understand why I do this to my self. Why do I eat so much that when we get back to the hotel it is so uncomfortable I want to cry? I think this is what being pregnant must feel like, a little. Portland was fun, I want to go back and experience more of it.  We had quite a bit of seafood while we were there, in so many different forms I feel totally inspired. That is why today I happy we are sharing this great Cornmeal Mustard Shrimp recipe with you. I am a big fan of cornmeal because of texture, and because of corn dogs. Mustard is something I grew up really not liking, but as an adult, I really love it. These two things married with shrimp it becomes one of those killer must try appetizer situations. I hope you all agree.

aVIt\u2019s Friday. Yes! It\u2019s been a really long and exhausting week. I\u2019ve been holed up in my kitchen frying, grinding and candying 40 lbs of bacon, grinding and seasoning about 3 hogs worth of chicharrones and a number of other kind of weird things, with a couple photo shoots scattered throughout the weeks cooking madness. Needless to say, my kitchen\u2019s a mess, my back hurts and I\u2019m so ready for this weekend\u2026.and this poutine. Oh poutine, what a glorious, glorious dish you are. French fries topped with whatever you want and eaten as a meal. Genius. This stuff is literally what dreams are made of and the 12 yr old fat kid in me freaks out every time it graces a menu. The awesome thing about poutine also is that I think each time i\u2019ve had it, it\u2019s been completely different. I\u2019ve had the basic French fry, gravy and cheese curd poutine, all the way to a Mexican style carnitas one that reminding me more of loaded nachos than poutine! Poutine possibilities are endless!
p18238
aVToday we have one with braised short ribs\u2026black garlic braised short ribs. Can we talk black garlic for just a sec? I feel like black garlic had it\u2019s moment as a food trend ingredient about two years ago, where black garlic roasted chicken was EVERYWHERE and then it went away. Oh how I hate \u201cfood trends\u201d\u2026but I won\u2019t go down that dark road\u2026not today at least. ;) I grew up with black garlic and if you have never had it\u2026oh man, its really awesome! It\u2019s basically garlic that has been fermented\u2026.yep, us Koreans LOVE to ferment! :) The flavor you get from black garlic is very different and not too reminiscent of \u201ctypical\u201d garlic. It has a very umami taste to it (for lack of a better word), with what almost seems like hints of smokiness. You can find it at some specialty markets, Asian markets and even markets like Whole Foods carry it, depending on where you live. We\u2019ll also be posting a tutorial in the nearish future, so look out for that!
p18239
aVAnyway, back to awesome poutine! The black garlic flavor in the short ribs is very subtle, but really tasty! We\u2019ve swapped out cheese curds for oaxaca because I LOVE the sharp, salty flavor and it melts SO well! The braise recipe itself is great on its own\u2026paired with some mashed potatoes and roasted veg. and you\u2019ve got dinner!\u2026then maybe make some poutine with the leftovers\u2026just maybe. If you\u2019re looking to indulge and totally \u201ctreat yoself\u201d you\u2019ve found the perfect dish for that! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
p18303
aV2. Place butter and flour in a small bowl and using the back of a fork, mash together until fully combined. Set aside until ready to use. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons oil into a large Dutch oven and place over medium-high heat.
p18304
aV3. Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper and sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove short ribs from pot and set aside.
p18305
aV4. Drain excess fat from pan and add remaining oil. Add onions, carrots and celery and sauté for about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add 10 cloves black garlic, and ginger and continue to sauté for an additional 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and thyme and stir.
p18306
aV5. Deglaze pot with red wine, making sure to scrape any browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom, with a wooden spoon. Boil until liquid has been reduced by one third. Add short ribs back to the pot, in a single layer and top with broth.
p18307
aV6. Add the cinnamon stick, star anise and brown sugar and stir together. Bring to a boil, cover and place into the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until ribs are fork tender.
p18308
aV7. Remove short ribs from braising liquid and set aside. Skim excess fat from top of braising liquid and remove cinnamon stick and anise. Pour liquid into a blender (leave the center cap off and replace it with a damp towel, folded a couple times and your hand placed over it\u2026 this will prevent your blender top from exploding off [ due to the steam] as you blend) or using an immersion blender, add remaining cloves of black garlic and blend together until smooth. Return puree back to the pot and simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk in butter-flour mixture until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth and glossy. (if gravy is too thick you can thin it out with some beef stock and adjust the seasonings)
p18309
aV8. Remove bones and excess fat from short ribs and shred with two forks. (or my preferred way\u2026.with your hands!) Ladle 1 1/2 cups of gravy over shredded meat and toss together, add cheese and continue to toss together.
p18310
aV9. To assemble: Place a mound of fries onto a baking sheet and top with short rib mixture. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese just melts. Top with more gravy and sliced chives. Serve.

aVCan we talk black garlic for just a sec?

aVI feel like black garlic had it\u2019s moment as a food trend ingredient about two years ago, where black garlic roasted chicken was EVERYWHERE and then it went away.
p18316
aV;) I grew up with black garlic and if you have never had it\u2026oh man, its really awesome!
p18317
aVIt\u2019s basically garlic that has been fermented\u2026.yep, us Koreans LOVE to ferment!
p18318
aV:) The flavor you get from black garlic is very different and not too reminiscent of \u201ctypical\u201d garlic.
p18319
aVThe black garlic flavor in the short ribs is very subtle, but really tasty!

Okay so technically these guys are called \u2018cherry peppers\u2019 or \u2018pimentos\u2019 and \u2018peppadews\u2019 are technically the trademarked brand name of a company based out of South Africa\u2026but as cute as pimentos and cherry peppers sound, I think peppadew sounds the cutest! Also, I got actual peppadews for this recipe, but please note that you can use any variety of pickled cherry peppers/pimentos and it\u2019ll be just as great! Anyway, why these? why now? Eh, because every now and then you need to \u201ctreat yoself\u201d and this is totally one of those treats. They\u2019re super easy to whip up and I know the deep frying factor is a buzz kill for many of you, but you really only need a small pot with a few inches of oil and the process is not all that messy\u2026or doesn\u2019t have to be! You can try to bake these, but I haven\u2019t tried yet and I\u2019m not sure if the filling will come bursting out of them or not\u2026other than that issue, they should hold well in the oven. :)

VSalmon Rillettes. This is such a great spread to make for parties, but it is also one of those things you can put on anything. Some things that come to mind are putting it in a grilled cheese, on a bagel, in cucumber cups, or just with some fresh veggies. As a tuna salad fan, I gotta say this is going to be my new go to when I\u2019m in the mood for fish quick. I love this stuff so much. It\u2019s so rich and creamy, and so easy to throw together. I also love that this is one of those recipes you can totally make ahead of time. Super easy entertaining. Hope you guys enjoy! \u2665 Teri

VHi Guys! I hope everyone had a great weekend AND I hope everyone is enjoying our redesign +
p18604
aV on how to Clean and Artichoke. We\u2019re so excited now that the new site is up, because if you guys haven\u2019t noticed we have new sections that are going to bring about some fun recipe/posts/and more! Oh and ps\u2026our recipe index now includes photos! Yay, right?! It\u2019s SO much easier to find the recipes you\u2019re looking for!
p18605
aVAnyway, back to today\u2019s recipe. Other than a cheese/charcuterie plate, this has been my go-to summer appetizer. If you invite me over to you house this summer I will most likely bring a fat platter of these. :) I really love these Grilled Peach and Burrata Crostini, they\u2019re so easy to throw together and they\u2019re so delicious! Teri and I had this out at a dinner party a few weeks back and sort of fell in love. This recipe doesn\u2019t really require \u201cmeasurements\u201d so much, but I wrote some down, just so you guys have an idea of how much of each thing you\u2019ll need so you don\u2019t run short of an ingredient as you assemble. The balsamic drizzle is totally optional. It adds a wonderful tartness to the crostini. You can also simmer the vinegar until it\u2019s reduced by about one third to one half. This will thicken the vinegar as well as bring out a nice, rich, sweetness. Again, while the additional of balsamic is great, I think this dish can totally stand on it\u2019s own.
p18606
aVWhat are some of your favorite summer appetizers? I\u2019d love to hear about them! I hope you all had a great weekend and think maybe we could all use a little more grilled peach and burrata crostini in our lives, but I don\u2019t know maybe that\u2019s just me. Enjoy!  xx, Jenny

I am salivating while writing this because I remember the moment when this cheesy goodness laid upon my tongue and exploded my mind. How can you go wrong with brie, really? The chives are awesome, and the pecans give a nice crunch. We paired it with crostini, and apple slices, however, this is the kind of dip you can shove anything into it and it will still be delicious. Please make this.

VBeing someone who is more attracted to meat than healthy stuff, I have never purposely eaten fava beans. When I say purposely I mean that I have probably had them before at some place where they shoved them into a pasta or something, but I have never gone out of my way to purchase them and prepare them. Mostly because to me they look like giant green beans, and green beans are just not that great. So I just assumed fava beans would be not that great either. I was wrong. My first experience tasting a fava bean was much like 
p18712
aV At first peeling the fava beans is kind of cool kind of gross. I really couldn\u2019t decide which one it was more. The little beans to me look like spider fetus sacks or something. This is probably a personal reaction and no one else will probably feel that same way. Anyway, once you put it in your mouth its surprising because it is actually a lot sweeter and smoother than other beans. The flavor is kind of rich and refreshing. So this Favetta Crostinis topped with Smoky Sauteed Shrimp we have going on is my new favorite snack / appetizer. The colors are so pretty together right!?! The green of the fava and the pink of the shrimp. I think it\u2019s so pretty. I hope you all will give this a chance!

VSome people like deep dish, some like thin. Some people like extra cheese, some people like white pizza. Some people like crusts, and some people throw them back into the pizza box like a chicken bone you just finished sucking clean. I do not understand the people that do the latter. Pizza crusts are like free bread sticks. Why would you not want to eat a free bread stick? In my opinion the ONLY reason to throw the crust away is because the good portion of the pizza is so packed with delicious stuff you want to make room for more. That is the only acceptable reason to me. That\u2019s it. So these Pizza Wheels we have going on today are amazing. Why you ask? Because there is crust ALL THE WAY AROUND, so you get crust in EVERY single bite. The cornmeal in this recipe ensures your crust is crispy and delicious, the way a legit crust should be. I am pretty obsessed with this recipe, and I feel like all you crust people will be too. If you\u2019re not so much into crust, that\u2019s ok. You\u2019re weird, but you will still love these.

VWe love us some fresh spring rolls. These Tamari Glazed Maitake Spring Rolls are one of our ideal snack / appetizer situations. It\u2019s a fun alternative to eating light, healthy salads. These spring rolls are packed with fresh veggies and you won\u2019t even miss the meat because of the hearty maitake mushrooms. The mint adds an extra dose of freshness that we absolutely love! The dipping sauce is also super clutch! It really awakens your taste-buds with flavors of sweet, spicy, tangy, briny, and tart vinegar. The best way for us to describe it is as an umami flavor explosion!

V\u000aThis week EXPRESS asked us to host a cookie decorating party as part of an event to launch their holiday collection. We went to town and bought a million different kinds of sanding sugars, dragees, jimmies, and luster dusts. We had the best time meeting and decorating cookies with the other ladies at the event. We thought it would be really fun to share with you our sugar cookie recipe and some tips and tricks so you can host your own cookie decorating party!
p18854
aVBecause we were throwing this cookie party to celebrate EXPRESS and their new holiday collection, we thought it would be cute to have fashion cookies. So we got a bunch of cookie cutters in the shape of t shirts, high heels, dresses, and skirts. We pre-flooded everything so that by the time the party started people could get straight down to the fun part, which is decorating. It was so cool to see how creative people got with the decorations on their cookies.
p18855
aVWe also made really cute take home bags so people could travel with their newly decorated cookies. The bags may look fancy, but they are so easy to make! All we did was run some white kraft paper goodie bags through our printer and printed out some circle labels. If you want to get really crafty, we cut out a little paper ribbon our of paper we printed a pattern on to use for a little color and extra decoration.
p18856
aVIf you guys are thinking about throwing your own cookie decorating party, here are some quick and easy cookie decorating tips to help you guys get the best results!
p18857
aV-
p18858
aV this particular icing can seem intimidating, but trust us, its totally not! The recipe we provided gives you a stiff icing, perfect for piping lines and creating detail work.
p18859
aV-When working with royal icing, it\u2019s best to first divide your batch into small bowls and create all your desired colors (if you\u2019re using professional grade gel colors, begin using a tiny bit at a time and continue to add more and more as you need it. It\u2019s so concentrated that the nice shade of baby pink you were going for will suddenly be hot pink before you know it! I usually dip the end of a bamboo skewer into the gel colors and dab my icing and mix. I do this until I get the color I want\u2026little by little.
p18860
aV-Once you\u2019ve loaded your piping bags and are ready to begin decorating, remember that you\u2019ll get a better result when your tip doesn\u2019t actually touch the surface of the cookie. You want to sort of \u2018air\u2019 drag the line of icing to create a border or any detailed work.
p18861
aV-flooding cookies: once you\u2019ve created a border and it has fully dried, you are ready to add a small amount of water to your icing to loosen it and then pour it into the area you want filled. I like to use my finger to spread the icing around and a toothpick for smaller areas.  The icing must dry completely before you can begin decorating.
p18862
aV-it\u2019s fun to paint the surface with luster dust and we used it like paint by dabbing a small amount onto a paint brush and painting it on dry as well as adding a small amount of alcohol to the luster dust to make it more concentrated/deeper colors\u2026just play around and have fun with it!
p18863
aV-since we brought all the cookies pre-baked and flooded with plain black and white surfaces, we also created what we called our \u201cglue\u201d for the evening. It was a super loose royal icing (1/2 cup royal icing plus 2 1/2 tablespoons water) that we used by dabbing onto a paint brush and gently brushing onto the cookies to allow sprinkles and other decorations to properly stick to the surface.
p18864
aV-patience is key here! I know that sucks, but you\u2019ll really achieve the best results if you wait for each application to dry before moving onto the next! (this is why cocktails (or nonalcoholic, but sparkly beverage) snacks and great company are always a good idea!

VHi Guys! I\u2019d like to get straight to dumplings, if that\u2019s okay\u2026 because I.LOVE.DUMPLINGS. (that should be a shirt, by the way\u2026just a thought) Yes, we have Pot Stickers for you today and they\u2019re awesome. :) I love pot stickers because they\u2019re as basic as it comes, when it comes to dumplings, and it\u2019s the type of snack you can fill with whatever suits your taste!
p18971
aVToday\u2019s Pot Stickers recipe is sort of a mixed bag of Asian ingredients, but the dipping sauce is very Korean. Choganjang is a Korean condiment generally made of 3 parts soy sauce and 1 part vinegar. It\u2019s great to use for dipping pot stickers, but I really love adding a spoonful to hot, kimchi dumpling and rice cake soup\u2026 so good! As we get into chillier months you can guarantee we\u2019ll be sharing said soup with all you lovelies.
p18972
aVNot only is this recipe super easy to throw together, but it\u2019s quick and delicious! These little guys also freeze really well. I love making a giant batch of these pot stickers and freezing them for whenever I want them. You can also make them slightly healthier by going full steam on them and skipping the pan frying all together. You can also skip out on \u201cfancy\u201d crimping and go straight-edged if you prefer. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VHi Guys! Today we have something super delicious for you! Cachapas!! They\u2019re Venezuelan corn pancakes and they\u2019re amazing! Both savory with a hint of sweetness from the corn, they\u2019re also soft and very reminiscent of buttermilk pancakes in texture\u2026.light and fluffy.
p19035
aVThe boyfriend and I had this for the first time this past spring in Playa Del Carmen. We has heard of this amazing little arepa spot in town, and since I\u2019m a total whore for a good arepa, we set out for town. We were expecting to enjoy a tasty lunch and ended up with so much more. We were greeted by the owner, who was a small, but very jovial and loud man who was walking around serving guests, cleaning tabletops and singing songs. We soon learned that he was a Venezuelan gentleman who had moved to Mexico two years ago, from his homeland, to open his restaurant in an area where the competition for the type of food he was serving wasn\u2019t so high.
p19036
aVWe were pleased to hear that it was the best decision he could\u2019ve made for himself! He said since his move, his small business had really been a hit in town, plus because he rides his bike to work everyday, he had lost almost 40 lbs in his short two years in Mexico. On top of this mans good fortune in a new country, he also talked about and served his food with so much knowledge and passion. While we went into the establishment for arepas, we also ordered the cachapas, per his suggestion,\u2026filled with shredded beef and queso fresco. Delicious!!! It was light and crisp on the outside, but soft and cake-like on the inside and with the shredded beef and cheese filling, it was rich, well balanced and just perfect. Cachapas are probably one of my favorite things to eat now!\u2026especially because the filling ingredients are endless!
p19037
aVToday I\u2019ve shrunk the cachapas down to bite-sized and topped them with a vegetarian filling\u2026I mean hello meatless monday! You can totally make a couple large ones to and stuff them if you prefer\u2026these are just party friendly, that\u2019s all.  I sauteed up a bit of red onion and poblano peppers and topped the cachapas with that mix as well as diced tomatoes, minced cilantro (a lazy man\u2019s pico de gallo) and crumbled queso fresco. I know my recipe isn\u2019t authentic and I\u2019m not even going to attempt an \u201cauthentic\u201d version\u2026I\u2019m leaving that to the pros, like my new friend in Playa. :) I do like how the texture of this recipe is very similar and reminiscent of the meal I had last spring.
p19038
aVIf you\u2019re looking for a great new/different app to bring to your next social gathering or you want a quick, easy and delicious meal just for yourself, I think these cachapas will hit the spot! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VHi Guys! I hope everyone had a great Halloween! Teri and I just got back from our quick trip to San Francisco and I spent my evening watching scary movies, tending to trick or treaters and carving pumpkins with my love. It was the perfect, quiet Halloween night! The boyfriend and I had our big Halloween hurrah last weekend with friends\u2026plus we may have also dressed up and dressed our dog up as the 
p19055
aVfamily and gone to the local dog park, where volunteers held a fun (fundraising) festival for dogs fully equipped with boutique vendors, a food truck, silent auction, agility area, bake sale, photo booth, and costume contest. All I have to say is the Redondo Beach dog community is absolutely amazing and I\u2019m thrilled to be a part of it! I couldn\u2019t believe the amazing turnout! So many obsessed owners and their precious dogs came (most even dressed up!) and the event was a complete success! I\u2019m really hoping to become more involved next year by baking some homemade dog treats to donate to the event. I think that would be so fun!
p19056
aVAnyway, totally switching gears from my \u2018I\u2019m a crazy dog lady\u2019 story to today\u2019s recipe\u2026we have these yummy Salted Dulce De Leche Bars! They\u2019re super easy to make and so very rich and decadent. It\u2019s the sort of recipe that could possibly send you into a sugar coma; that\u2019s where the salt comes it. Not only does the salt balance the sweetness in the recipe, I love a hint salt when baking with oats as well as creamy dulce de leche. I finished the bars with chopped butterscotch chips\u2026 why chopped? Chopping the chips allows for the butterscotch flavor to come through in the bars without the added hard \u201cchip\u201d texture, which I think is a little too much. These have really been my go to dessert lately, to bring to parties, meetings, etc. They\u2019re super quick and easy and such a crowd pleaser! I highly recommend making these salted dulce de leche bars, even if it\u2019s just to satisfy your own sweet tooth! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VI just spent a huge wad of cash on the internet buying epic cover everything spf 1000 sun screen and rash guards with built in sun protection. I am going to Hawaii for Thanksgiving! So excited to hang out with my family and soak up with sun (which means sitting in the shade). I am a really pale human. I realized this when one time I went to the Bahamas and got a sun burn so bad that I was peeling everywhere. It was so gross. I had a picture of myself on facebook from it, and it was by far the most commented picture of my facebook. Why? Because all my friends commented with remarks like \u201cyou\u2019re so tan!\u201d I have since deleted the photo because I was in a swimsuit and I don\u2019t want to have facebook pictures of myself in a swimsuit. Needless to say in preparation for winter swimsuit situations, I have been trying to eat well. So when we made this Black Pepper and Lemon Asiago Dip it was really hard to be good and not eat all of it. I had like 10 bites. Still good, because there was quite a bit left. This is one of those go to cheesy delicious easy dips. We paired it with sweet potato chips, which are very delicious, but I think it would be amazing with celery sticks or carrots. Yummy!

p19165
aV, one of my favorite things to make of all time in the world of dips. So delicious. I am happy that we are now giving you another warm dip recipe, this time a Hot Crab Dip. The thing about this crab dip is that it is LOADED with crab, like as much crab as we could possibly fit into this recipe without it just being crab. My other favorite parts are the corn, which gives this dip a nice texture, and the bell pepper. All delicious and live together so nicely when baked and smeared on a warm toasted crostini. We made this for recipe for all your people that watch the Super Bowl. I will be watching that one live stream that has kittens and puppies running around a mini football field because that is much more my speed. Enjoy!

We served ours with sides of our

VHi Guys! Thank you all so much for your much needed feedback about my nerdy fogging sitch, your responses were all so helpful and very appreciated!! Anyway, lets get right into this tasty spicy chocolate sheet cake. I love chocolate cake. The end.
p19366
aVJust kidding\u2026although I do love me some chocolate cake. It\u2019s something I find that I don\u2019t eat often at all\u2026maybe once or twice a year if a birthday rolls around, but if I\u2019m in a situation where chocolate cake is involved I will almost never say no. Today\u2019s chocolate cake is just a little bit special. From the outside it might appear to be a basic chocolate cake, but once you dig into it you taste the layers of smooth chocolate, with deep earth notes from the stout and with hints of spices from the Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. It\u2019s nice because if you can\u2019t handle a lot of \u201cspicy\u201d you\u2019ll still be able to handle these\u2026it just adds an extra \u201csomething\u201d to the cake. Why a sheet cake?\u2026because sometimes all a girl has time for is a sheet cake. :) The peanut butter frosting might push this over the edge just a little bit, but it\u2019s holiday season so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s totally okay. Maybe this could be that fun and unique dessert you\u2019re looking for to dress your thanksgiving table?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

aVThis Sunday my boyfriend and I will be running in our very first 5k. I\u2019m so scared\u2026.like petrified. We moved into a new apartment a couple months ago, which happens to be right next to the beach. When we moved we promised each other and ourselves that we would try our hardest to not take living by the water for granted and that we would make the most of beach living. I guess it has sort of become our suedo \u201cresolution\u201d for the year\u2026.so far, so good!
p19464
aVSomething we\u2019ve taken up due to the move are beach runs. It\u2019s honestly something I NEVER thought I would be doing. I like a good yoga and spin class a few times a month and have even dabbled in a little barre, but running\u2026noooo thank you. I\u2019ve tried going for runs in the past and it\u2019s always ended up the same\u2026I get dressed, get my \u2018pump up\u2019 playlist set up, fill up a bottle of ice water for when I return, then somehow 2 hours later I\u2019m still at home avoiding the run and then it never happens. I\u2019m such a lazy procrastinator sometimes!
p19465
aVAnyway, I have no idea why, but this time around things are different. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re both so committed and we\u2019re doing it together, but it seems to have gotten easier to actually push myself out the door and get my legs moving. It\u2019s totally weird and kind of freaking me out, but I also sort of love it. So back to this Sunday, yep we\u2019re running our first 5k together the morning of Super Bowl and we\u2019re both really excited with a very healthy side of terrified. I know for many people 3.1 miles doesn\u2019t seem like much at all, but I\u2019m totally not one of those people. Not to mention, about a month after the Super Bowl run, my sister and I will be participating in a 10k together up in Santa Barbara (both our alma mater). I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in way over my head, but I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll survive both runs\u2026although the jury\u2019s still out\u2026.like what if I trip on my shoelace and fall over? or what if I somehow get lost? (I know in a sea of 10,000 runners, this might seem difficult\u2026I\u2019m just sayin\u2019) OR the worst\u2026 what if I straight up have a meltdown during the middle of the run?! Helpful tips and suggestions from anyone who has participated in this kind of stuff is very, very welcome and appreciated!!
p19466
aVSomething that\u2019s keeping me a little more motivated about the run this Sunday and having to get up early, is that fact that I\u2019ll be making these pickled pulled pork sandwiches. Plus the timing couldn\u2019t be better; I\u2019ll be able to set the pork shoulder up in the morning before we head out the door and by the time we\u2019re home and everyone\u2019s ready to eat the shoulder will be totally melt in your mouth soft and ready to shred and serve.
p19467
aVThis is actually the only dish I make in a slow cooker (specifically our multifunction 
p19468
aV). I never grew up eating slow cooker meals, simply because slow cookers are just not something my family used. This though in my opinion is the perfect slow cooker dish because it\u2019s so easy and mindless to throw together with mouthwatering and \u2018punch you in the face\u2019 flavorful results\u2026.and now I\u2019m thinking I might dabble around with this slow cooker a little more. Maybe tomato braised oxtails?! We shall see. Any tips for this slow cooker novice is also very much appreciated! :) If you\u2019re looking for a super delicious yet easy Super Bowl dish\u2026here you go! Don\u2019t want to make sandwiches?\u2026no problem, turn them into tacos! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VChicken Fried Potatoes. These are glorious. Crispy on the outside thin potato slices and a French fry in the middle. So that\u2019s pretty awesome right? We also made a homemade buttermilk ranch dipping sauce. This is one of my favorite appetizers we have posted recently because it\u2019s really simple to make, not a whole lot of ingredients, and its totally delicious. Once you have your assembly line down for the coating of the potato slices everything else is a cinch. It\u2019s really easy to make batches and batches of these. You all know these would be perfect for Super Bowl, but I think these would be perfect for lots of situations, like as a side dish to our

V asked us to create some perfectly easy recipes to celebrate the Oscars. You all know we love making cute little appetizers so obviously we were so excited. For our menu we decided on a simple yet elegant cocktail, an herbed deviled egg, and a really yummy salted caramel and chocolate tart! All of these recipes are really simple and easy to throw together. We also think our 
p19575
aV would be great if you\u2019re in the mood for a dip. You may also want to try 
p19576
aV, which is a personal favorite.
p19577
aVWe also have a couple of really quick and easy tips to decorate your Oscar Party.
p19578
aV\u000aThe first one is edible gold. I know we have mentioned this before but you can add a little bit of edible gold to anything, like we did with our Salted Caramel and Chocolate Tarts, and it will automatically take it up a notch. We found ours at an Asian market, but you can easily order it online after a quick google search.
p19579
aVFor our Oscar party decorations, we used a combination of tissue paper garlands, as well as garlands we made out of gold tinsel pom poms. The gold tinsel pom poms are inexpensive and really easy to make into a garland. We used a regular needle and thread, and half inch and one inch tinsel pom poms. You could also use the tinsel pom poms glued to the top of skewers to make really festive swizzle sticks for your drinks! They\u2019re so versatile!
p19580
aVAn easy way to dress up plain paper plates is to use edible gold spray paint. You can tape off part of the plate and spray only a corner for a nice pop of color. You can also lay parchment paper over the area of the plate you wish to block off. A large re-closeable plastic bag also works, just place the plate inside with a corner left out and spray away!
p19581
aVWe don\u2019t know about all of you but we are so excited to check out everyone\u2019s dresses. That\u2019s the best part right? What are you guys planning for the Oscars?

aVHey Guys! Is everyone getting ready for the super bowl?? As usual we\u2019re both getting ready and excited for the fun food that usually comes along with this \u201choliday\u201d sort of day\u2026.not so much the game, sorry! We feel like we\u2019ve been doing pretty well with keeping ourselves somewhat in check with the cheeseburgers, hot dogs, tater tots, and so on so just like we did this 
p19607
aV, we\u2019re treating ourselves again with these, 
p19608
aVThe idea for these actually came from the yummy eatery in LA, 
p19609
aV. This place serves up some unique Korean style fusion snacks such as Galbi Poutine, a variety of awesome and unique sausages and these fried balls. :) If you haven\u2019t had a chance to try any of their food we recommend it..go with a big appetite though as you\u2019ll want to eat everything on the menu and the items are pretty filling. Our fried balls are filled with a Korean style pork and kimchi fried rice and lightly coated and fried in a crisp panko breading. These balls pack tons of delicious and intense flavor, but if the heat is a bit much for you, cool them down by dipping them in our garlic-green onion aioli! Balance, people!
p19610
aVIn addition to us getting ready for the Super Bowl, we also have a neat giveaway today! We\u2019re giving away a 
p19611
aV. If you\u2019ve never heard of it, it\u2019s a tablet similar to the ipad and kindle, but designed specifically for the kitchen! That\u2019s right, this tablet comes  with tons of recipes already uploaded into it, plus it constantly updates new recipes, professional chef bios/demos (according to season and availability) and much more, so you\u2019ll never have a shortage of recipes to sift through. In addition to the recipes that come pre-installed to the tablet you can also do some basic web browsing and access your personal (media) accounts. So while it\u2019s a tablet designed for the kitchen, you can still use it to access your facebook or twitter accounts!
p19612
aVWe will say this, initially we were a bit turned off by the \u201cbulkiness\u201d of this tablet. Compared to an ipad this tablet is pretty thick and heavy\u2026.BUT what we didn\u2019t consider is that fact that it is meant to stay primarily in the kitchen (to help you not only with recipes, but demo videos, organizing grocery lists, etc) and even better\u2026.it\u2019s completely spill proof! Yes, you can get \u201cspill proof\u201d covers for your other tablets, but in this case you don\u2019t need one whatsoever. It also comes with its own kickstand, for much needed convenience when you\u2019re cooking. Our favorite part about this tablet, other than the great organization and ease to search through the recipes is the sidebar on the right hand part of the screen, that includes an area for your \u201cfavorites\u201d, a basic weather report and live radio!
p19613
aV We have randomly chosen a winner and that person is Jennifer who said: \u201cYears ago i found a recipe called \u201csuper dip\u201d, basically a burrito filling type dip that our children always called \u201csuper bowl dip\u201d so it became our \u201cmust have\u201d for the Super Bowl. Thanks for the chance at this giveaway\u2026.a device for the kitchen sounds great!\u201d Thanks guys!

VWhen I was growing up, my Mom owned a coffee cart at our college and Airport (which back then I think was technically a terminal because it was so small). I would often go with her to work as she stocked the shelves and what not. I hated going. We always went into the airport through the kitchen where they prepared all the food for the airplanes. It smelled horrible in there. Like cleaning solution and disgusting food. So naturally as a brat, I complained SO MUCH when I had to go. So my Mom would always give me a cookie from her coffee cart. At first I just ate shortbread, lots and lots of shortbread cookies, so much so I can\u2019t even eat them now. Later, she started carrying a local bakeries cookies. The chocolate chip cookie from there was unreal. Sweet, but not too sweet, moist, fluffy, everything you dreamed an amazing chocolate chip cookie would be. Since moving away I think about these cookies so often. So today we have our best ever Chocolate Chip Cookies. The main thing that is important is the fact these cookies are fluffy (mixed with a slight chewy texture). Why is that important? Because Chocolate Chip Cookies are made to be eaten with milk. The fluffy factor happening with these cookies lets the milk really sink in. Which means these Chocolate Chip Cookies are the ultimate cookies MADE for dipping in milk. I hope you love them as much as me!!

VWhen Teri and I are alone in the studio together there are a few things that have become lunch \u201cstaples\u201d. We\u2019re all about the working lunches so it\u2019s usually something that can be whipped up quickly, like one of our favorite things: DIY sushi bowls. Our other main alternative is turning to Urth Caffe. We love the large variety they offer and the eats are usually pretty healthy, yet filling.
p19762
aVAlthough a big positive is that they offer a large selection of salads, sandwiches, paninis, quiches, pizzas, etc. I seem to ALWAYS get the same thing\u2026.the D\u2019Lox pizza. I just really love this \u2018za and love that it usually takes me two sittings to finish it. The combination of the crispy crust with velvety pieces of smoked salmon, rich creme fraiche and then all the bright and fresh toppings create the most amazing flavor blast in your mouth. So good!
p19763
aVToday we\u2019ve created our own version of that amazing, yet simple pizza. You can alter this however you want! Sometimes I add a layer of thinly sliced cucumbers to the mix or crushed pepper flakes for a slight kick. I think as long as you\u2019re using fresh ingredients, you\u2019re all good. This is great to serve cut up for a brunch, cocktail party or just a quiet night in with a nice glass of white wine. The super bowl is coming up in the next week or so (I looked it up on the internets and everything!) and not everything necessarily needs to be heavy and fried. This is probably going to end up on my super bowl table this year as a delicious, healthier alternative to all the super rich dishes that are bound to cascade the tabletop. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

p19809
aV3. While yeast mixture sits, sift together flour and salt. Add flour mixture to yeast mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until fully incorporated and dough begins to form. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 8 to 10 minutes. (dough should spring back when poked)
p19810
aV4. Form into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and place in a warm area and allow to proof until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 -2 hours. Punch dough down and turn onto a clean, lightly floured surface.
p19811
aV5. Divide dough into two equal pieces and roll each piece into a 14 inch disc, about 1/4 inch thick. Cover baking sheets with parchment and sprinkle with a layer of cornmeal. (if using a pizza peel, sprinkle peel with thin layer of cornmeal)
p19812
aV6. Place crusts in prepared baking sheets, pierce the surface all over with a fork, and brush with small amount olive oil.
p19813
aV7. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Remove from oven and allow crust to cool before topping.

My mom never made it (she\u2019s not a big fan of frying or fried foods), but every now and then we would go to the Korean market with my mom and she would get us an order of honey and peanut (which by the way, peanuts need to be crushed and sprinkled onto a lot more savory stuff) glazed Korean fried chicken in the prepared foods section and we would happily nosh on the package together because it was a big pile of sweet, sticky, crispy, rich, deliciousness. Even if it was slightly soggy from steaming in the package on the way home, we didn\u2019t care, it was just that good to us.
p19842
aVI\u2019m not sure why this random childhood food memory of eating fried chicken is so clear in both our minds. Maybe it\u2019s because during the peak of our \u201ccat-fighting stage\u201d of sisterhood we were able to set whatever adolescent issue we had with one another aside and enjoy a casual meal together with a lot of parent gossip and laughs. Those times growing up were my absolute favorite.
p19843
aVToday we have a similar version of this nostalgic meal but in nugget form\u2026.yep, Korean Chicken Nuggets, and with a spicy Korean bbq sauce. These are easy to pop in your mouth bone/hassle free and although the sauce is quite spicy, the drizzle of honey helps to balance the heat and the black sesame seeds add a nice nutty flavor and crunch. (OR you can substitute crushed peanuts, which are also delicious) I know frying can be a pain in the butt at times, but when the right occasion calls for it, these are totally worth the extra work. Enjoy! xx, Jenny

V\u000aIt occurred to me that we don\u2019t have a pumpkin pie recipe on the blog. Pumpkin pie is my favorite pie on earth. It is so good that I even think pumpkin pie from Vons is good. I like pumpkin pie that much. I have done variations upon variations with pumpkin pie, and I still like a pretty normal filling. What I do like to experiment with is the crust. Ginger snap, vanilla wafers, or in this case chocolate! With the experimentation of crust I now have a new favorite pan, which is a tart shell pan. I love this way because when you finish baking and cooling and finally take it our of the pan you can see the beautiful crust. It is just so impressive! So today we are sharing with you a delicious and creamy Pumpkin Pie with a Chocolate Crust. I love the addition of chocolate. It just makes this pie that much more exciting. I hope you guys enjoy my most favorite pie ever!

VHello. Do you have a huge belly like me from Thanksgiving? I even gave most people who came for dinner leftovers and I still have more. I\u2019ve been eating it like everyday for lunch. Carb city. Its crazy. I feel disgusting, yet I do not want to eat a salad. Just cheeseburgers. And stuffing. And biscuits. And mashed potatoes. That\u2019s it. I am going to be a whale by January. Maybe I will drink those disgusting kale and other healthy crap fresh squeezed juice drinks. Probably not. OR, maybe I will just make my new years resolution to eat more salad and not be such a carb slut, and then not follow through, because that\u2019s what New Years resolutions are for, in my opinion. They just make you feel worse unless you have the self disciple of a person with awesome self discipline. That\u2019s not me. I\u2019m ok with it. Another factor to the fatness is boozing. However, booze is an important ingredient to all adult holiday parties. Holiday parties are practically unbearable without this ingredient. This spiced white wine sangria recipe is super festive and beautiful, and its a great way to make parties fun, or more fun.

aVDay three. Day three of this juice cleanse is just starting. I can\u2019t wait till its over, I can\u2019t wait till I can eat like a normal person again. Weird things happen when you go on a juice cleanse. After the first day, you can smell REALLY well. There is a McDonalds not far from the studio, and if the wind is blowing in the right way, I can smell McDonalds cheeseburgers. They smell SO delicious. Your mouth also begins to water uncontrollably when you smell pretty much any food. Like yesterday, my mouth watered when I smelled cocktail olives. I don\u2019t even like cocktail olives. I think the thing I miss most is chewing. I also think that we are all so dang lucky to be eating well all the time, and have the ability to eat pretty much anything we want at any time. Thats pretty cool. Tuesday is the first day I can eat anything I want, so I think we will be going and getting a crazy cheeseburger. In the meantime, I hope you all have a great weekend, and drink some Spicy Micheladas!

Bake mini loaves for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and fluffy. Set aside and allow baguettes to cool before slicing in half and assembling. (Tip: The baguettes can be made up to three days ahead of time and kept in an airtight container. They can be warmed in the oven at 200°F for about 10 minutes before using.)

The initial response to the release of our very first cookbook was amazing and it\u2019s all because of you totally kick-ass readers! So thank you, thank you, thank you! You guys really made our day!! I couldn\u2019t be more excited about Oct 9th and hope you\u2019re all

aVOkay, now to today\u2019s recipe. We have a
p20306
aV for you all today! Don\u2019t know what it is?? It\u2019s pretty much limoncello\u2019s less popular little sister\u2026.and absolutely delicious. The intense orange flavor that is extracted from the peels is sort of unbelievable. I\u2019m not a vodka fan myself, but man is this good! It\u2019s still quite strong, but on a hot summer day it\u2019s perfect with some muddled mint, over lots and lots of ice! I also like adding a little arancello to mimosas to \u201cspruce\u201d them up. ;) Just some small tips: using the freshest oranges will get you the best results (you can extract the most oil from them) and although many people just add the large strips of peel to the vodka, I highly recommend thinly slicing the peels, like I\u2019ve done above (you\u2019ll really get the most orange flavor this way). Anyway, I hope you all have a fabulous weekend and make this super, simple liqueur this weekend\u2026.so it\u2019ll be ready to go in a couple weeks! Enjoy!

p20314
aV2. Thinly slice the peels and place into a large jar (I like to use ball jars for this).
p20315
aV3. Pour vodka over peels, seal jar and allow mixture infuse in a cool, dry place for 2 to 3 weeks, shaking the mixture once every 2 days.
p20316
aV4. After 2 to 3 weeks have gone by, make simple syrup: combine sugar and water with a pot and simmer until sugar dissolves. Set aside and cool completely.
p20317
aV5. Once simple syrup has cooled, strain vodka and orange peel mixture. Stir simple syrup into infused vodka and serve over ice with mint leaves or add a small amount to your favorite cocktail for an intense orange kick!

aVHi all! Does everyone have big Easter plans? Even if you don\u2019t celebrate Easter, don\u2019t you always feel the need to be brunching every Easter Sunday? It just seems so appropriate, doesn\u2019t it? I have plans with the bf and his family\u2026.brunch, duh. Every year his family puts together a delightful Easter egg hunt (with prizes for the most found eggs), although the youngest person who attends is me (I\u2019m 27). The prizes are always Nordstrom gift cards, so needless to say my competitive nature comes out and I go full force. This year, I\u2019ll be doing the same\u2026barreling through my bf\u2019s aunts, uncles and grandparents to claim that last egg we all saw hidden in the bushes. No shame. None. :)
p20327
aVAnyway, I think this Hibiscus & Ginger Champagne Cocktail is the perfect [Easter] brunch cocktail\u2026.light, sweet, refreshing, and bubbly! The hibiscus and ginger both bring a great element of surprise and flavor to the drink. Plus, the hibiscus flower floating around is really pretty and adds a little extra \u201cwow\u201d factor, don\u2019t ya think?! Also, the ingredients really aren\u2019t as difficult to find as you may think; I got everything from Bev-Mo, even the Hibiscus flowers sitting in rose water syrup! I\u2019m pretty sure you can also get all these things at a Total Wine as well.

VSo, coke and red wine probably sounds horrible to you. It\u2019s not. Hear me out. Kalimotxo is a really simple and really refreshing drink. My dear friend Karin turned me on to them. In Boise, which is where I am from, there is this amazing Basque restaurant 
p20358
aV. They serve Kalimotxos there, and I always try to get one, and their croquetas, which are amazing. I was skeptical at first because like you, I thought coke and red wine would be disgusting. I could blab on about how coke balances out nicely with cheap wine, but I won\u2019t. Just make it, and you will be happy. It\u2019s easy, yummy, and I like the caffeine, helpful when you\u2019re super lazy and drinking. Give it a chance!

VMy favorite cocktail is a gin and tonic. Lately, instead of coming home to a beer, it\u2019s been a gin and tonic. Not in a lush kind of way, more in a Mad Men kind of way. It\u2019s nice to have before dinner, and most of all, its perfect for the disgusting heat waves Los Angeles has been having. The good thing about gin and tonics and that the base of the drink is already there: gin, and tonic. You can add pretty much anything you want to this drink and it will be yummy. I add raspberries a lot, sometimes blueberries or basil, and sometimes-just mint. Whatever I have extra of really. This however has been by far my favorite flavor collaboration. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!

aVHi Guys! We\u2019re so excited to have teamed up with 
p20426
aV to recreate some of her amazing recipes. Not only are we recreating them, but we\u2019re adding our own modern twists! First up we have Lilly\u2019s Cranberry-Orange Ginger Ale\u2026.yum, right?! We\u2019ve taken this classic cranberry-orange combo and pumped it up by replacing the orange juice with freshly squeezed tangerine juice. We\u2019ve also swapped the ginger ale with cream soda\u2026.who doesn\u2019t love a nice, thick cream soda? Finally, we incorporated a very subtle rosemary simple syrup, which helps to cut a bit of the richness in this creamsicle mocktail, it helps the drink maintain the perfect balance of refreshing and sweet. If you please, you can also add a bit of gin into the mix for an extra kick. Enjoy!

aVI know the elections and over, and no one wants to hear about it anymore, but I\u2019m really into flag hair lady. She is the new NASA man with the mohawk. It\u2019s hilarious to me that people get so captivated by these kinds of things, and weirdly thrust these people into twitter / internet / meme fame. I love it. I just wonder at what moment when she got home did she realize she was internet famous? And why did she decide to put that flag in her hair anyway? Was her arm tired? I really hope someone does an interview so all of  my flag hair lady questions will be answered.

aVOnto this drink. I have always loved all things apple drink. I grew up on Martinellis Apple Juice (from costco of course), and Sparkling Apple Cider is one of my favorites. The mom and dad even had Martinellis on their first date in the move Parent Trap (the original, always) which was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I have always loved this stuff. So when we wanted to make a yummy fall cocktail the cider was the obvious choice. Not to mention we could put cute apple stars in the drink. How do you like them apples? (had to, sorry).

If you don\u2019t already know, Jelly Bellys has this product called \u201cBean Boozled,\u201d where in they basically have twin jelly beans. One is the good delicious twin, and the other is the evil disgusting twin. They look the exact same, so if you get a gross one then you have been bean boozled. I said this all night in my best impression of

aV. It was fun. Let me just tell you, the gross flavors are totally totally so disgusting. I think the worst is barf, jelly belly nailed the acidity in that one. I would have loved to be in the room while their flavor scientists were taste testing. We had some left over boxes and I tried to convince my boyfriend to bring them into work and leave them in a dish in the kitchen for April fools. He didn\u2019t. Probably because he is a really nice guy, and I would have totally done it because I am mean.
p20540
aVGross Jelly Bellys have nothing to do with this cute little drink we have. Do you like the pear star? It is really easy to make. I am also very into bubbly drinks. Jenny is a huge bubbly drink fan, and whenever we go out for lunch we now both get something bubbly. It is so nice in the middle of the afternoon because it\u2019s not some crazy heavy sugar thing.

VHi Guys! Today we have a fun little drink for you. Summer Shandy!! I\u2019m a total (craft) beer and champagne lady myself and during hot summer months I\u2019m usually craving one of these guys. Currently, I\u2019m digging  nice, strong IPAs, but when it\u2019s super hot I just want something light\u2026with a small kick! I use a nice wheat based hefen, which lighten up tremendously with the addition of lemonade, but feel free to use a pale ale of your choice. It\u2019s really up to you. I like making my own lemonade, using fresh organic lemons, because it makes me feel a little less trashy about drinking this awesome drink. :) Anyway, I hope you all enjoy a nice Summer Shandy during these hot summer months! xx, Jenny

V\u000aI have been soooo lazy lately. So lazy, I have been exercising in bed, doing some leg lifts, or lifting light weights. So lazy, so dumb. What doesn\u2019t help the lazy situation is the computer. I get really obsessed with a certain item I want, like 1960s flatware or whatever, and check etsy and ebay daily. Sometimes I find the same item on ebay and etsy, obviously posted by the same person. I just want to buy both and be \u201cHA! Caught you! What are you going to do now!\u201d But I don\u2019t. This lazy week also translates into not wanting to cook. Ever. God I love the internet and online meal ordering. So I like to make things like drinks and smoothies because it makes me feel fancy and like I am accomplishing something. In a food blog world (lately) that has filled itself with colorful popsicles, I can\u2019t help but think about them all the time.They have become the inspiration for this drink. I want to say summer in a glass, but I won\u2019t (even thought I just did. Now would also be a good time to say sorry, not sorry, but I hate that saying). This Sparkling Blackberry Lemonade has the color pops I\u2019ve been loving lately. This is a great drink to make for groups, and the sparkling-ness of the drink makes it light and refreshing. Yum. Enjoy!

VI feel like this cocktail is really important to know how to make. This Simple Bloody Mary recipe should actually be called \u201cBreakfast and hangover cure in a glass.\u201d When the holidays come around everyone is boozing it up, lots of hangovers at our house anyway. Bloody Marys are some what of a tradition for me when it comes to this time of the year. It\u2019s funny because the first time I had a Bloody Mary I thought it was really gross. I think it\u2019s the kind of drink you like when you get older. Like coffee, or scotch on the rocks, or brussels sprouts. Now I love them in all their spicy tomato-ness glory. So if you have never made one at home, do yourself a favor and prep by getting all the ingredients before you have a big night out. Thank me later.

aVI love artichokes and I love a creamy, warm dip\u2026..enter Hot Artichoke Dip. Yum. Most of you are probably looking at your screen just sweating thinking about it. I know I know, even though it\u2019s almost fall (yay!) it\u2019s still hot out here in LA (boo!) and I\u2019m sure in other areas as well. BUT in a time when artichokes are abundant I love to take advantage of them in all ways including making this classic dip. I\u2019ve made mine a little different by using mascarpone instead of cream cheese because it\u2019s a tiny bit more mild, but cream cheese is totally acceptable. I also roasted the garlic because I LOVE roasted garlic; like have you ever smeared some roasted garlic on a crostini followed by some melted triple cream brie and topped it with a slice of sweet bosc pear and a couple of candied walnuts?! SO GOOD! Please excuse my completely off topic food tangent, it happens a lot.  I just really, really love roasted garlic :)  Anyways, back to this dip. Make it, share it, eat it. It\u2019s fast, easy and totally hits the spot when you\u2019re craving something not so healthy (and yes using baked whole wheat flatbread chips was indeed my sad little attempt to make this a little more healthy) Enjoy!

I love this drink and it\u2019s not too sugary sweet, I really hate that. You can use any kind of gin, but I prefer using \u201cTanqueray Rangpur\u201d for this drink because of the great lime flavor infused into the gin which goes really well with the cherries! Here\u2019s a tip: make pitchers of this drink at a time. Trust me :)

aVHi All! Hope everyone\u2019s having a great week! Teri and I just got back from a quick little trip and we\u2019re exhausted\u2026.but more on that to come :) I love to travel, whether I\u2019m going around the world or hoping in the car for a speedy road trip, I\u2019m pretty much down for it all. The only problem, I\u2019m constantly shoving decadent, rich, sweet, luscious things in my mouth (no self control, people\u2026absolutely none) the whole trip that I usually come home 5-8 lbs heavier. This would be totally fine with me if I didn\u2019t actually 
p20962
aV like I had gained the rapid weight which then automatically makes me feel sluggish and grumpy\u2026.toxic combo. So whenever I get home, I usually spend a few days \u201cdetoxing\u201d.  These Roasted & Stuffed Baby Eggplants are one of those snacks I consider to be a \u201ctrip detox\u201d snack. Quick, easy, delicious, fulfilling. Yum.  Even if you\u2019re not \u201cdetoxing\u201d from a trip this is a really great snack to have at anytime, or a great hors d\u2019oeuvre to serve at a cocktail/dinner party. Try it this weekend! Do it, Do it, Do it! Or don\u2019t\u2026.but I\u2019d be a happy camper if you did. :) Enjoy!

V\u000aHi All! Today we have a simple jam recipe for you\u2026that\u2019s also really tasty! We\u2019re making use of all the awesome rhubarb that\u2019s been popping up this last month or two! Jam is something I really love to make during summertime. Berries are inexpensive, it\u2019s super easy and makes great gifts for really any time of the year. Rhubarb is something that makes a really great addition to jams and I love utilizing it in more than just as pie filling! The cardamom and cinnamon also add great flavor to the jam. I would recommend using the spices rather sparingly as they can easily over power the rhubarb and raspberry flavors. If you\u2019re big rhubarb fans like us, you\u2019ll love this jam! We also have another awesome and totally different rhubarb inspired recipe for you all on Friday\u2026so watch out\u2026and of course, enjoy!

I mean sure, maybe I got dressed for my run at 9am and anxiously dawdled around my apartment for a bit, postponing the much dreaded \u201cexercise\u201d for as long as I could. I was thinking of every excuse not to go through with this run. \u201cHm, my bathtub needs to be cleaned\u2026RIGHT NOW. Then I have to load the dirty dish towels in the washer\u2026RIGHT AFTER. Oh and then I should probably organize my closet RIGHT AWAY because I\u2019ve been meaning to for weeks now\u2026..\u201d 4 hours later the run happened. 33 minutes later I was back in my home\u2026.baby steps, people. As suspected, I felt crappy and tired before and during the run, but fantastic after! I plan on going for another run this weekend and hope it doesn\u2019t take me another half day to get myself motivated and moving around. We\u2019ll see. :)
p21064
aVAnyway, today we have another rhubarb recipe\u2026in sauce form! We\u2019ve paired this rhubarb and sour cherry gastrique (a sweet and sour type sauce) with a tasty roasted rack of lamb and some simple fixins\u2019 (parsnip mash\u2026.my current obsession, and sauteed broccolini\u2026.so simple and tasty). This sauce is also really great with roasted duck, if any of you are into that\u2026.I totally am!

V1. For the lamb: Preheat oven to 375°F. Place oil into a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Season rack on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear lamb (fat side down, first) for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and allow to rest, about 5 minutes. While the lamb rests place the panko, tarragon and melted butter into a small bowl and mix together. Brush the mustard over the lamb and top with a layer of the panko mixture, gently pressing to ensure the crust sticks to the lamb. Place lamb back into sauté pan, crust side up and roast for about 15 minutes [for medium-rare] and about 20 minutes [for medium]. Allow rack to rest for 5 to 7 minutes before slicing and serving.
p21142
aV2. For the Gastrique: Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan and sauté shallot over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Add rhubarb and continue to sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Stir in orange juice, vinegar, port, and sugar and simmer until the mixture has reduced by 1/3. Add the remaining ingredients and stir. Simmer until the mixture is just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Discard the star anise and bay leaf. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of butter and spoon over roasted lamb.
p21143
aV1. For the Parsnip Mash: Place parsnip and potato chinks into a medium pot and fill with water. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Boil parsnips and potato for about 25 minutes or until fork tender then drain. When the mixture is still hot add the butter and begin mashing the mixture with a potato masher. As the mixture begins to breakdown, begin adding the cream or milk until fully incorporated. Generously season with salt and pepper. Fold in green onion, if using. Serve warm.
p21144
aV2. For the broccolini: Pour oil into a large sauté pan and place over medium-high heat. Add broccolini and sauté for about 4 minutes. Add garlic and continue to sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.

VHi Guys! We had a blast in Austin, ate a ton and are so happy to be back! I learned A LOT and came back totally inspired with so many fun recipe ideas. I can\u2019t wait to share them with you in the next month or so\u2026.lets just say there are both awesome hot and cold SMOKED thing in the near future (totally easy too!)! Today we have rhubarb pickles for ya. I love pickled things of all kinds, I love the basic cucumber pickles, I love gherkins, pickled onions, pickled garlic, pickled carrots, pickled pigs feet, pickled eggs\u2026.I LOVE pickled things. One thing I love to pickle is rhubarb. That\u2019s right, no need to save up precious stalks of rhubarb during the summer for just pies and crumbles\u2026there are so many awesome savory things to do with rhubarb and pickling is one of them! I like to think this is similar to those giardiniera pickled peppers and other vegetables, only rhubarb. I like eating my rhubarb pickles atop hot dogs or I also like dicing it up with olives and spreading it onto a giant Italian beef sandwich for a little kick and tang. One of my favorite things to do with these pickles is to serve them with a little bit of cheese and charcuterie. The sharpness of these pickles goes great with the rich meats and cheese.
p21188
aVI\u2019ve made these pickles rather sharp and sour, but feel free to adjust the spice, sugar and salt amounts based on your own preferences! I just prefer a more sour pickle, but if you\u2019re more into a bread and butter type sitch feel free to add an extra tablespoon of sugar. You can also omit any of the different spices I\u2019ve added, because there is certainly a lot going on in there. If you\u2019re more of a dill pickle type of person, then feel free to omit some or all of the spices and drop a handful of fresh dill into the mix. Pickles can be such a personal thing, I urge you all to try out these rhubarb pickles and adjust them to fit your taste. Have a great weekend! xx, Jenny

I totally get a little insane when it comes to figs. Still not buying my chopping up the Marcona almonds?No problem! After the figs come out of the oven, instead of chopping them, just keep them whole and stuff them right into the figs, just like the cheese :) Enjoy!

aVPINK COCKTAILS! Yep, and its not some unnatural weird stuff to make it that pretty. It\u2019s prickly pears. Do you know about them? You cut them open, and they are the most beautiful bright pink color. So we used them to make some cocktails, and my favorite kind: fizzy cocktails. The first time I had a cocktail with an egg white in it, I thought it was going to be a little strange but it turned out to be really light and makes a nice fizzy top to your drink. We made this cocktail to be a little flexible, you can use just plain old simple syrup, or you can pair it with one of these three fabulous Morris Kitchen flavored syrups. Here is where the giveaway comes in.

aVI woke up really early this morning to this weird recurring dream I keep having about whales. I don\u2019t do much other than count them from high above the water. I decided this morning that I would good what my dream meant. It turns out that having whales in your dreams means you are intuitive. They also said it could be because you are watching too much of that tv show Sea Shepard. Either way, I think this means that maybe someday I will use my intuitive senses to become psychic and be the hot girl version of Edward. Yes, that was a Twilight reference. Yes, I did watch Breaking Dawn part 1 yesterday, and it was pretty bad, but I still kinda like it. So there\u2019s that. Anyway, we have figs for you today. Figs are my very very very most favorite thing to make appetizers out of ever. The shape and color of them are perfect, and you cut them open and they are even more beautiful than the outside. I am always sad to see them go, so I try to eat as many as possible while they are in season. We have paired some grilled figs with a simple ricotta and hazelnut spread, then drizzled everything with honey. Honey and figs is like peanut butter and jelly, can\u2019t get any better. Go out and take advantage of fig season before it leaves guys! And make these Fig Hazelnut & Ricotta Crostinis!

aV. Also, with two cats, it gets gross and having a robot in my house to suck up cat hair is pretty cool. The things that are not so cool is that I have somehow managed to program the Roomba to start a cleaning cycle at 3 in the morning on Sundays. At first I thought my cat magically stepped on the cleaning button, but he did not. I\u2019ve tried to figure it out how to un program it, watched the dvd that comes with it and I just can\u2019t. So basically my fix is to box the Roomba in at it\u2019s charging station on Sunday night and then it can\u2019t move. HA. Teri: 1 Roomba: 0.
p21462
aVI\u2019ve been trying to think of a way to tie in my random Roomba story and there isn\u2019t a way. So let\u2019s just talk about these Butternut Squash Cranberry & Goat Cheese Crostini. This is basically fall bruschetta which I freaking love, because I loooovvveeeeee butternut squash so much. These simple little crostini are so pretty and colorful and look like leaves when they change for fall (I felt so pinterest inspirational quote-y when I typed that for some reason). You can add hazelnuts if you want a crunch factor too.

VThis Austin trip Jenny and I took was amazing. I slept really well, and it was a super fun break from the normal everyday. The normal everyday being wakened up twice in the middle of the night around the same time from my ginger senior cat yowling at walls for no reason. A quick google will reveal that he is totally going insane because he is old. It is really strange. He sits and stares at things, and then falls asleep, staring at things. He gets hyper like once a week and runs around on a crazed rampage with a wide eyes look on his face, then goes right back to sleep. It is sad, but funny and weird at the same time. I think this part in his life will become my favorite because as a grumpy old man, he has no problem letting his freak flag fly.
p21526
aVIf Tigger (my senior cat) were a human, I would make him this Rhubarb Raspberry Crumble. We would eat it together, and I would ask him what he finds to interesting staring at walls, why he likes to cuddle so much, and why he doesn\u2019t like it when I touch his cankles. This is one of those delicious easy desserts (or lets be real, breakfast / whenever) dishes that are best when it is still warm. So plan accordingly, and don\u2019t forget ice cream!

VHi Guys! If you haven\u2019t notice, Teri and I are stoked about the fall season. Not only do we get to put on our cozy clothes (if LA will just hurry up and make up its freakin\u2019 mind about the weather!!), but we get make cozy dishes and eat cozy foods! Today we have beer cheese soup. I grew up a mere hop-skip away from Wisconsin (hello Mars Cheese Castle) and have had my fair share of real beer cheese soup. If you\u2019ve never heard of it, imagine extremely flavorful cheese sauce that\u2019s infused with beer and slightly thinned for a pleasant mouthfeel\u2026.that\u2019s basically beer cheese soup. Awesome, right?!
p21636
aVWe\u2019ve infused ours with pumpkin and thyme (I love the combo and may have featured it before\u2026
p21637
aV) for a more seasonal type of soup, but if you think straying from the original is an abomination (which is totally okay, because I even went back and forth a number of times, trying to decide if I should stick to classic or go seasonal) you can totally nix the pumpkin puree, thyme and nutmeg for an equally delicious soup. You can also switch the pumpkin ale out for a simple pilsner, which is what I usually use. What I like about the addition of pumpkin here is that unlike most things infused with pumpkin, the flavor in this dish is extremely subtle. It adds a bit of sweet, richness to the soup, but that\u2019s it\u2026it\u2019s really not too \u201cpumpkiny\u201d at all. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love me some pumpkin, but for this soup I love that it doesn\u2019t fight the beer or the cheese or the overall soup for that matter. I also blend this soup, which is not super typical. I blend the soup because I like it with no little bits inside and I feel it makes the soup super silky\u2026if you like the veggie bits, no problem\u2026just whisk the beer/broth mixture into the cheese mixture, being careful not to break your cheese sauce.
p21638
aVThis soup is easy to make and keeps well for up to 5 days! Oh and one random thing before I go\u2026.this has absolutely nothing to do with today\u2019s recipe, but has anyone seen the quinoa burger/Bud Light commercial? If not, please go watch it 
p21639
aV! It might be the greatest commercial out there! I\u2019ve probably watched it over a hundred times this last month and I love it\u2026.so hilarious!! Maybe after you guys watch it you\u2019ll be inspired to make our quinoa burger\u2026which does NOT taste like a dirty old tree branch thankyouverymuch!! Enjoy and have a great weekend!! xx, Jenny

aV has earned itself a new Teri voice. A voice I didn\u2019t even know I had in me. Let me explain, to those of you that have animals you probably have an \u2018talk to you animal voice.\u2019 I totally have one, its pretty good, and really annoying. Jenny has one, her voice is so high and quite though, humans can definitely not hear it as well as her dog. My friend Adrianna\u2019s animals voice is louder than mine, and she gives animals attitudes. My voice is like a 5 year old boy talking. My new ermahgerd meme voice is like me talking with braces when I had my bands on. If you don\u2019t know what bands are, you\u2019re lucky. They are rubber bands you attach to the metal of your teeth, and it makes it hard to open your mouth. People often think you have gum stuck in your teeth. Anyway, I\u2019m really excited about my new meme voice. Sometimes, it\u2019s so fun to be really annoying.
p21755
aVIn honor of my new voice, I am going to ermahgerd you with a new fall soup recipe for your repertoire. This is a silky and smooth perfectly fall soup right down to the color. See those little balls in there? Those are rice balls. Basically this soup already comes with a far superior version of saltines. I love more than anything to put saltines in my soup, but the fact this soup has rice balls in it, makes it the one and only soup that doesn\u2019t need that salty addition. Its ermahgerd! good.

I have always loved Claire Danes, since the days of My So Called Life, but man, does she have one of the ugliest/amazing cry faces ever. She is so good at her cry face it makes me depressed, because I become sad with her. So, being obsessed with cry faces, obviously I googled \u201cClaire Danes cry face.\u201d What would come up but a wonderful

p21812
aVOk, moving on from cry faces and onto muffins. Most of the time, I am not really a huge muffin fan. I can attribute this to my parents\u2019 obsession with Costco and the flats of muffins they would buy for the house. These muffins were the size of my face, and a flat consisted of chocolate chip, blueberry, and poppy seed. If I wanted a snack, it was \u201cEat a muffin.\u201d I became over muffins. Quickly. It wasn\u2019t until my late twenties that I explored the muffin world again. Still though, I am only really interested in muffins that don\u2019t cross over the flavor types of muffins in my past. Therefore, I love these muffins. Perfect bits of fall in every bite. Perfect, cozy, pretty, drink coffee and read a book muffins. Dig in.

He hates it, I can\u2019t get enough. Baked potato chips? He loves\u2026I\u2019ll pass and go for the kettle cooked ones. Fresh tomatoes of any kind? Yes, please!!\u2026for him, not so much. Avocados?\u2026.Um, YUM ALWAYS!!\u2026 he likes them, but not in sandwiches. Our sushi choices? He\u2019ll have anything unagi related while I prefer the uni and raw scallops. I could probably go on and on, but you guys get it, right?

aVThe boyfriend and I spent the greater part of the weekend indulging in House of Cards. We just can\u2019t get enough. We only have a few more episodes of season 2 left to watch and now the feeling of sadness and regret begin to sink in, wishing we had taken our time a little more to savor each episode. It\u2019s okay though because it was really great just being a boob on Saturday with my guy.
p22077
aV\u000aSo I\u2019m really excited about our post today because it\u2019s dehydrated citrus wheels! I love when winter rolls around and we\u2019re able to enjoy all the fun seasonal citrus. I specifically get really excited for tangerines, blood oranges and Meyer lemons. Although the process can be a little tedious because of the time, dehydrating citrus wheels such an easy thing to do with beautiful results and lots of great uses. You can use your dehydrated citrus wheels to flavor a simple hot tea, chopped up and added to soups/stews, pureed into a powder and mixed with herbs and spices to create a custom rub for meats and seafood, or you can even mix it with other whole spices like cinnamon sticks and star anise for a fragrant and homemade potpourri.
p22078
aV\u000aIf you\u2019re having a boob-ish sort of day then why not put on a marathon on your favorite show while dehydrating some citrus? It\u2019s so easy and your entire place will smell sweet and delicious for hours! Enjoy! xx, Jenny

VI hope everyone had a nice few days off, whether you celebrate Christmas or not. Did anyone do anything awesome and out of the ordinary? Did anyone eat anything awesome? Christmas time for me is usually spent with the boyfriend and his family and it\u2019s always a great time. On christmas eve we play white elephant, Spoons, sometimes watch old home videos (which I LOVE!), eat a delicious meal, and walk around the block where a few blocks of neighbors coordinate setting up a bunch of tree lights (in addition to other decorations) for the public to come over and walk around. It\u2019s very sweet and one of my favorite things to do each christmas. The day of is more low key and dedicated to an amazing brunch, gift exchanging and the boyfriend\u2019s mom\u2019s failed attempt at getting everyone involved in karaoke.
p22108
aVI didn\u2019t make a single edible item for either meals this year, because I was just way to busy. It bummed me out ever so sightly, but then again having a day or two off of cooking was pretty nice. I\u2019m not going to allow the same thing to happen for our New Years Day brunch, so I\u2019m going to make these little guys, our Roasted Persimmon Pinwheels. They\u2019re super easy to throw together (I feel like I say that all the time, ha!), are super cute and totally delicious!
p22109
aVI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, I love roasting fruit. It caramelizes and concentrates the flavors so well and in this case the roasted persimmons add a nice warmth that pairs beautifully with buttery puff pastry and rich, spiced cream cheese. If you\u2019re looking for a last minute new years day brunch item to take with you to a get together I recommend making these tasty bites. You can even switch the persimmon out for another fruit of your choice or even a few pieces of nice chocolate for an even more decadent treat. I hope everyone has a nice and relaxing weekend! xx, Jenny

aVis about traditional Southern Italian food\u2026.Just kidding !(sorry, just had to throw in a very bad/dumb joke!) This book is all about boozy beverages (although some can definitely be made without booze, for a tasty nonalcoholic treat). We\u2019re no mixologists and will never claim to be, but we both have a great appreciation for thoughtfully crafted cocktails.
p22167
aVOur book is broken down into four seasonal chapters and the recipes are a mix of our own personal creations, some classics and a handful of modern twists. We love scratch cocktails so much of our book involves using fresh juices and making your own flavored (mostly herb infused) simple syrups and garnishes. It\u2019s a cute little book that makes great gifts for anytime of the year! Plus it\u2019s small enough to fit into most purses or large pockets\u2026.so feel free to travel with it\u2026and we\u2019re not even kidding, ha!
p22168
aVWe\u2019re celebrating our new cookbook release by taking advantage of the gorgeous abundant citrus all around us and making simple and delicious blood orange mimosas! We\u2019re also celebrating with a little 
p22169
aV!! That\u2019s right, we\u2019re giving away 4 copies of our book today! Just leave a comment in the comments section at the bottom of the post, letting us know what your favorite winter cocktail is\u2026 it\u2019s as simple as that! Just make sure to include your email address so we can contact the winners for shipping addresses!

aV, so get your comments in asap! We really hope you all love the book as much as we do and can\u2019t wait to see what you think!!
