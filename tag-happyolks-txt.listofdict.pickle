S'description'
p2
VI have started one thousand sentences in my mind telling you what I have seen and felt and tasted in Patagonia. Nothing is working. The Andes whispered to me potent, precious secrets that helped me remember my human aliveness and mended my exasperated spirit. It occured to me just now that they are secrets that still need keeping. Secrets to hold fast in my belly and pray on, to take out and set on the counter to look at and ponder, to play with and practice and live in the best way I know how. In the 140k we hiked and climbed and cried upon I said thank-you a million times, prostrated on my knees to glaciers, rivers, forests, the sun, the moon, the stars and knew that those million thank-you\u2019s would never be enough for what the place and time were giving. Sitting at the kitchen table weeks later to write you, thousands of miles traveled to and from this spot in the interem, I sense that everything is the same and yet everything is different. My soul works from the same physical body, I drink my coffee from the same chipped cup. In between what I can see and what I can feel though, life is changing. Memories and mistakes sit together on the mantle now next to the old California license plates and the empty vase that I\u2019d like to fill with daffodils this afternoon. They are invisible masterpieces cherished, forgiven, and understood only by we who know the brokenness and beauty it took to create them. I urge you to go out, far from home, and find the secrets waiting for you too. They are, as Walt Whitman says, more divine and beautiful than words can tell. Pisco Sour, three ways Pisco is a (typically) colorless grape brandy produced in Chile and Peru. It is the star of what both countries claim as their national cocktail, the Pisco Sour. In Puerto Natales, the closest township to Torres del Paine where we trekked, we met a young man who when asked about the Pisco Sour closed his eyes, touched his chest and said, \u201cAh, my Pisco, when you drink it you will feel a light your soul.\u201d I happen to think he\u2019s right, but the time and place seemed to have unusually persuasive powers. I have three takes on the Pisco Sour for you here today. The original, the de Campo with honey and ginger, and one to bookmark for summer with fresh mango and Seranno peppers.

V\u201cIf you are divided from your body, you are also divided from the body of the world. Which then appears to be other than you, separate from you, rather from the living continuum to which you belong.\u201d \u2014 Eve Ensler  This theme, that of the body and women, and our constant attempts to correct or control what is lacking of our physical selves and in our lives has come up in too many conversations lately. With dear friends, young and old, wise our chats have led to, among many things, some variation of the question:  why, when everything feels out of control, do we sometimes turn on our bodies?  In some last ditch effort to keep things together, we, women, often become these punishing, masterful tyrants, who live secretly in the shadows of our self-consciousness and inadequacy and restrict and pinch and squeeze and shudder at all that our bodies lack. In the name of health, deprive ourselves of the joy  we deserve and mask the deep disequilibrium in the vessel we inhabit. As Eve says, we are then divided. Our bodies become an object to fix, and then too does the world. The world is not an object. Your body is not an object. I read something in an Oprah Magazine on a flight home from college a few years ago that still haunts me. There was this featurette on women in their 60\u2032s and 70\u2032s espousing the joys of finally coming into their own skin in their later decades. It featured a photo series of women, beautiful, eyes closed, laughing, wind blowing in their wavy grey hair. They all looked so happy, genuinely, finally, happy. I was happy for them, too. I also felt like I was going to throw up. The idea that I, and all women my age, might spend the next 40 years of our lives unhappy with and at war against our bodies was terrifying. I tore out the pages of the spread and stuffed them in a textbook tucked in the seat-back pouch, closed my eyes and thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait that long\u2026 I can\u2019t wait that long\u201d What if I don\u2019t even get that long? I mean, how dare I waste this time? No way, no how. Self-love is not a rite of passage,not  something we are entitled to only after years of suffering. I\u2019m not entirely sure where I\u2019m going with all of this, but I\u2019m not trying to stand on a soap box to convince you to love your body \u2014 there are women leading that call-to-action with much greater poeticism and punch than I ever could. Of course, if I were sitting on the back porch with you tomorrow night, I\u2019d promise you and plead, with deep conviction and sincerity, that you are the most powerful and beautiful creature on the planet. Yet I do want to tell you one thing: go outside. Get out in the sunshine and warm air and away from the noise of the city and your routine and let your limbs take you places and show you parts of the earth and the living continuum to which you belong. The closer you get to nature, the harder it will be to hate your body. You belong to these places. They will remind you of your goodness and beauty and strength that you may have forgotten lives in you. It takes nearly four hours to summit 3,800 feet of a mountain like one we filmed above. As the altitude increases, our pace tempers and at each pause for oxygen, I stand filled with so much gratitude for what my body is, for what it does, for how hard it works to bring me to these places. Here, in the wildest parts of the earth, I know in my heart I lack nothing. Every maddening, dark thought or ill will I have felt towards myself in the past is dismissed and deep love and care fills the vacuum it left behind. You may not need to climb to 14,000 feet to find this peace. Maybe you\u2019d like to learn to hula hoop, swim backstroke in a lake, train for a 5k fun run. I don\u2019t care. Something. Move. Breathe. Look out and look in. Watch how much your body allows you to do and feel. Give thanks. Be kind. Let\u2019s not wait until we\u2019re 70 to feel good about the vessel we landed to change the world from. There is freedom in appreciation given. Folks, this is killer. For what this cobbler lacks in beauty it makes up ten-fold in taste, especially after a full day on the move. Not much mise en place when it comes to camp cooking, and I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. Any summer fruit combination will do. I had strawberries and rhubarb on hand for this trip. I imagine peaches, plums, cherries, or blackberries will be fantastic as they come into season this summer.

VMy kitchen is old. My counters are laminate. My spice cabinet is a joke and I\u2019m pretty sure mice live under the fridge. There are splatters on the ceiling still from the time Corbyn and Shaun made Margaritas in a blender missing it\u2019s top. New dish towels and a clean rug in front of the sink are a big deal to me. An old friend from San Diego visited our place a few weeks ago and remarked at how normal, homely, even ugly our cooking space is, despite what she sees online. I love our house. I love our quirky, odd lay-out of a kitchen. We\u2019re all in this funk-a-licious life together, ya hear? And in the spirit of reality checks, I love to cook and share quirky, semi-technical, creative dishes with you here\u2026 but five of the seven days in a week we\u2019re eating some riff on grains, greens, and protein. Cheers to rentals, easy dinner, and comfort in a bowl.

VThe coffee shop I find myself holed up in these days is a six-block walk from my house. I cross two one-way streets, then a busier intersection between a 24hr diner and a yoga studio. On my way home today I kicked up dead leaves that seem to suddenly have engulfed the sidewalk since Monday and considered calling my mom on speaker phone just so she could hear how pretty the crunching and swooshing sound was in the moment. I have a feeling she heard it, without the call. She usually does. Mom-thoughts generally lead to other gratitude thoughts, and today was no exception. Gratitude for friends who let me interrupt their work-day to speculate if the person sitting next to me is either a hit-man or private investigator based on the prolific mess of records, security camera footage, and license plate captures strewn about the table. Gratitude for the way the Universe ushered an amputee-veteran to my check-out line at Target yesterday while I was purchasing pimple-cream alongside halloween candy with even the slightest grudge against my otherwise perfectly functional body. I heard an echo of crunching and swooshing behind me as I stopped to cross the last street before our house and looked over my shoulder to catch a glimpse of the situation. Just a teenage-girl carrying a violin case. We acknowledged each other and crossed in tandem when there was a break in the traffic. She carried on ahead of me, swinging her case down the walk and I watched her from our porch for a minute or so, tossing my keys between my palms before going inside. There is an unspoken language between women that had been expressed between us in crossing the street and I wondered if she even knew it had transpired or the power it holds. When I was her age I don\u2019t think I did.  We are stronger when we cross together.  I was a wildly independent in my youth. The sort of, I-don\u2019t-need-anyone-to-help-me, I-can-do-it-all-on-my-own, type. In those days I associated feminism with unbreakability and ferocity, reserving all my tenderness or vulnerability for those in my inner circle. My relationship to my own femininity (and femininity at large) in those angst-y teenage years has softened as I\u2019ve aged. With each passing season I find myself coming closer to a place where I can honor my emotional expressiveness, impulse to nurture, and keen sensitivity as having equal value to my fiery determination, independence, and fearlessness. Today I actively seek crossing the street with another, not as a crutch, but as a way to understand the female species and learn my place and call within it. I set down my backpack on the couch and thumbed through the mail before kicking off my shoes and heading upstairs to check on Shaun. He was at his desk, just as I had left him several hours ago, reading Supreme Court documents for a new film project while sports commentary played in the background. I hugged him from behind, and closed my eyes. Earlier in the day I had confessed to a friend that I felt like I had nothing profound or compelling to write about my life or the world these days in this space. I get to wake up next to my best friend, I am involved in challenging and fulfilling work, and my friendships bring me deep and profound joy. Am I possibly too content to write? Is that even a thing? Contentedness, what is this witchery? Is it possible? Can I only create art when I feel melancholy or restless or at dis-ease? If good writing is a product of emotional carnage then I might be wise to consider a new career path. I kid. Along these lines, said friend reminded me that I\u2019m a normal human living normal days, as we do, and that I have permission to set poignancy on the shelf every now and again. \u201cSome days you\u2019re just a girl living her life.\u201d  And I\u2019m cognitively very aware of this truth. Anyone who knows me will assure you I\u2019m  TEAM REAL-LIFE . And, even though the work I\u2019m most proud of is born from some less-than-awesome mental states, the less-dramatic and emotionally stable days are the ones I like best and know you do too. The ones with walks and thoughts of pimples and hit-men and femininity and questions if I should go to therapy and if we should buy a second car and why my sweater smells like curry and when there will be enough snow to snowshoe and if brie or camembert cheese is a better accompaniment to squash and flaky crust. And so it goes. This is my life, and I\u2019m just happy to be in it.

It\u2019s okay if wedges overlap. Bake for 15-20 minutes until just softened and a little al dente in the thicker regions. Set aside and cool.

Begin layering cooled squash, apples, cheese, and a bit of salt and pepper leaving a 1 1/2 inch border for folding it all up. Repeat until you run out of ingredients and can top with more cheese. Fold the border over your squash-apple-cheese tower pleating the edge to make it fit. Finish outside exposed dough with an egg wash.

VI stood there, in the cold of the morning, hunched over the kitchen sink with my hands gripping the counters ledge watching the leaves fall and collect on the deck. Trying to count my breaths, I silently beg each one to play it\u2019s reverse card and go back to the tree, the life-force, that created it earlier in the spring. They do not stop. With each yellow sliver that drops, I feel myself being pulled down to the ground with them. Pieces of my heart and understanding lay there, wilting, disentigrating back to the earth. I wished for Autumn all summer long \u2014 for it\u2019s first snow, cold sheets, fires in the living room. Now that it\u2019s here, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to dig through the \u201cbasement\u201d for all that needs supporting it. Things have settled, and suddenly the stillness I asked for has arrived with a pretty bow and a painful but necessary awareness to all that has really taken place from January to October. I\u2019ve highlighted and bookmarked  Tiny Beautiful Things  to shreds during this phase. Is it a phase? Can we call it that when it hasn\u2019t yet passed? Anyway, Cheryl Strayed\u2019s words are both comfort and a total slap in the face right now. In one particular letter, a young woman writes to Cheryl asking \u201cWTF, WTF, WTF?\u201d She responds in sharing the bone chilling history of sexual abuse from her father\u2019s father and how she came to realize that pressing against the wound, tackling it straight on, was the only way to get a grip on her life. She ends her response to the young woman, \u201cAsk better questions, sweet pea. The fuck is your life. Answer it.\u201d I share this passage not because I stood there staring at the leaves thinking, like the young woman who wrote Cheryl, \u201cWTF, WTF, WTF.\u201d But I realize that the leaves falling is my life. I need to answer it. Simple as that. I need to ask better questions about the  why.  Ask questions that shed light on what needs adjusting. So you\u2019re feeling like \u201cx\u201d you\u2019re acting like \u201cy\u201d and it\u2019s causing a sour, hollow feeling in your gut.  It\u2019s not WTF. It\u2019s your life. Dig deeper. Lean in. Throw yourself down the basement stairs and scavenge for as much as you can. You\u2019re going to need all of it, everything you got, to make it to winter.

VMany years ago I was on a flight from Boston to Dallas after the funeral. My heart was swollen with grief, my head pounded with rage and questions about loss. Sick and lonely, I sat in an aisle near the front of the plane and stared blankly at two stewardesses gossiping and locking, unlocking, locking cabinets in preparation for takeoff. A little girl lept, literally, across the threshold of the plane behind them. We made eye contact and I smiled at her. She was four years old, maybe five, I never can tell the ages of children. Turning back to her mom, then back to me, she bounded toward the corner of my seat and placed her tiny hands on my crossed knees and shouted \u201cYou are the most beautiful princess I have EVER SEEEEEEENNNN!!!\u201d I began sobbing, instantly. I don\u2019t remember anyone looking at me, the hot, soggy mess that I was. I don\u2019t remember being embarrassed. I only remember feeling more peace, anguish, and assurance than I had ever previously known, or have perhaps known since. I share this with you, friend, because I know that little girl is looking for you right now. She is bounding down the aisles of your life to tell you, remind you, that despite your brokenness, you are a bright shining light in this world. You are worthy of joy and happiness. Despite your mistakes and wrong turns, you deserve the sun and the moon and all of the stars. The pain you feel, the questions that keep you up at night, the sadness you harbor, the wounds you hide for friends and colleagues \u2014 all of this, all of these things, will make sense one day. Not today. And that\u2019s totally fine. It\u2019s okay that things are not okay. If you lived here, I would hope to find you sitting on my front porch tomorrow evening as I returned from errands. I would hold you. I would hold you so tight. Then I would make you a grilled cheese sandwich and we might drink the good wine straight from the bottle and I would tell you about the little girl and the plane and how wonderfully fucked up and outrageously mind-blowing the Universe seemed in that moment. Because that\u2019s what there is, you know. Madness and wonder. Joy and agony. Fear and freedom. All at once, all the time. Remember that night in Beijing after we had that god-awful duck and saw a show at the Peking Opera house and it was so cold in the theater that we could barely feel our toes? We found a bathroom in a bar down the street at intermission and the insides of the stalls were completely covered in mirrors. Everywhere. Head to toe mirrors in front of us behind us, above us. We laughed hysterically and you asked me from the stall next door,  \u201chave I been drugged?!!\u201d  I sat with my pants at my ankles and laughed,  \u201cwell, if you\u2019ve been drugged, so have I.\u201d  We were in China. Sick and stuffed with duck and happiness. We were also in China, having no idea, really, where we were, and had found ourselves in a bathroom where it was impossible to  NOT  look at our tired, pale, puffy-faced, half-naked selves and wonder about the meaning of life. I remember blowing steam on the wall to my right and watching my reflection become hazy. I closed my eyes and prayed that we\u2019d never forget who we were and how we felt in that moment. The magic. The hysteria. The total confrontation of self in the most bizarre and unknown circumstances. There was this feeling that the situation reflected upon how perfect and awkward and hilarious and terrifying the best and worst moments always are. I mean this in all seriousness. For you and me, girl, there will be times in our lives that will somehow all boil down to one vulnerable minute, sitting on the John, and  really  seeing ourselves\u2026 seeing ourselves, and coming to terms with what\u2019s looking back. I think you\u2019re upon one of those times. What do you see? Dear friend, I want you to know that you are the most beautiful princess I have ever seen. Your losses, regrets, sins, and secrets. Your exstacies, braveries, dreams, and triumphs. All of it, a masterpiece. Every last bit. Breathe in, breathe out. Dig deep. I love you.

VWe lounged on the couch all day on the first. No crisp morning run and green juice to follow. No, we just laid there, me curled in tie-dye and yoga pants, you in the flannel with the pink stain on the pocket from where your sharpie exploded in the spring. We ordered bad pizza and watched the new Bourne flick until it got dark and the streetlights out front turned on. You looked at me and reached for my hand at one point with a new look, one I haven\u2019t seen you wear before, it said  holy-shit-what-a-freaking-year.  I felt the same thing but didn\u2019t say anything. I took your hand and smiled.  What a freaking year  was right. This picture  has been the screen saver on my phone since it was taken in January of last year. We were home for my holiday break and everything that stood before us seemed bursting and bright, albeit completely undefined. I had one semester of school left and we intended to foster a few more dogs, run a few triathalons, and move. Move somewhere. Anywhere. Away from California, preferably, but we weren\u2019t picky yet. You wanted snow, and I wanted interesting people. We were both undaunted by any of it until the spring. Crap.  You mean we actually have to decide, now?  New York, Denver, DC? I interviewed in Brooklyn while you filmed Sprout and we crunched the numbers. I wanted the job, but hated the city. Flying home I remember trying to summon every ounce of wisdom Paulo Coelho or Mary Oliver or Oprah would promise me I had inside to turn our sails the right way. May came quick. I didn\u2019t get the job in Brooklyn, thankfully, and DC got put on the shelf for later. I passed French 3 and marched to Pomp and Circumstance wearing a cap without a tassel or permanent address. We said goodbye to the ocean the next morning and hit the road. Alaska first. Big fish. Deep introspection. Hours of Mexican train dominos and the very best company. I didn\u2019t know I could love so much outside of my own kin until your grandparents. I sold my car and we camped along I-80 until a flat tire parked us in front of the duplex in Denver that we now call home. You built me a garden, I learned about marmots and bears, mountains and altitude became our new addiction. We made fast friends. You traveled a lot for work, I missed you terribly. At the end of the summer I got a \u201creal\u201d job and things changed, again, as they do. For the first time in my life I understood what exhaustion looked and felt like \u2014 you saw it in my eyes and in my distance. In the bowels of it all I met people, saw things, felt things that I didn\u2019t even know myself capable. Things were hard. It felt like someone took our little snow globe and glued it to the ceiling, everything looked misshaped and backwards and we held each other upside down like that, so tight, shocked, stunned by it all. We were both free and trapped. Happy, but terrified. Bright eyed and blistered. There were mornings like the one after the first snow, we ran far and fast, in silence, our legs red and tingly from the cold, or that night of the Ben Howard show where I wondered if I was getting closer to or even further from myself, closer to or further away from you. It was a free fall. We made questionable choices, spoke important truths, and held on for dear life as the time and place tested all that we were, are, and will be. I looked at  the picture  of us today, the one on my screen saver of you and me and Buddy, a whole year later, a year older and stronger, and see the best parts of it all. We were so happy. So darn certain that despite the hardship, heartache, and the dramatic changes that lay before us, our love would kick it all in the pants. I look at that picture and I want to go back and tell those two kids that, yeah, it\u2019s gonna be a crazy road, CRAZY TOWN, but keep believing, keep going, because your love will kick life in the pants and guess what, IT TOTALLY DID. Sitting on the yellow couch with you eating pizza a year later, seven years later, really, I\u2019m so glad we postponed our resolutions a day to just give thanks. We made it. It was our hardest and best year.  For all the obvious and secret reasons I love you. I love you so much. I love what we do, I love what we believe, I love how fucking hard we work to make this relationship right. Here\u2019s to you and to 2013. Here\u2019s to the mountains we\u2019ve climbed and the many more before us. We\u2019ve got this. Made a little money playing in the bars With two beat up drums and two old guitars From the Crescent City to the Great Salt Lake It ain\u2019t what you got, it\u2019s what you make When the road got rough and the wheels all broke Couldn\u2019t take more then we could tow Making something out of nothing with a scratcher and our hope With two old guitars like a shovel and a rope Rock of Ages, cleave for me Let me hide myself in Thee Now I understand On better terms since Birmingham Shovels and Rope

VWe have a backyard now, how cool is that? Shaun built me raised beds and I planted winter squash early last week, probably too many, but we\u2019ll get there when we get there. Every morning I sit in the sun on an old red adirondack that the last tenant left behind and watch over blossoms and the beneficials as they do their good work. I\u2019m bonding with the squash, seeing phases of my life in them. So eager, reaching their awkward arms to the sky. They want to grow up so fast. Every day I am astounded at their progress. So proud. Like a parent, I suppose. Worrying about the sun and the birds, trying not to smother them, let them just do their thing. Just like the plants, I am reminded, the power within (within me, within us all) grows stronger with each new day. Keep watering. Keep nurturing. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ll be patient, trust that good things will come to fruit in the near future. In the meantime I will celebrate the small triumphs, fend off the bad bugs, and just soak up the time given to me. It\u2019s summer, folks, let\u2019s try not over think things too much. Take the time (make the time) to ride bikes, call your mom, take a hike, figure out the grill, play dominos, sing in the shower, drink beer at the ball game, laugh at yourself, be nice, and eat lots and lots of stone fruit.

Let cook for 12-15 minutes. Strain, rinse with cold water, and let sit to dry while you prepare the rest.\u000a

aVIn a large bowl, combine minced shallot, finely sliced green onion (white and light green parts only), parsley, and mint. Carefully remove the seeds  from the jalepeno and mince as fine as you can. I used 1/4 tsp, but add as much as you like to amp up the heat. WASH HANDS and surfaces, immediately. It only takes one time rubbing your nose without a wash to remember this tip. Add pepper to the mixture. Slice the apricots in crescents with a paring knife over the bowl (8-10 wedges per fruit). Squeeze lemon juice over the fruit before stirring. Add olive oil, salt, and pepper.\u000a

VWhat\u2019s a paraben?  Shaun asked me last week as he began to sort through the footage from the  Sprout  shoot. I\u2019m about as low-tech as it gets in the beauty and skincare realm (yeah, I use coconut oil as shaving cream) but I know that parabens are not welcome in my bathroom. I thought about how to explain and realized that, actually, I have NO idea what a paraben actually is.  My response:  I know it\u2019s bad for our health and the environment and that\u2019s why we should use the natural stuff, and, err, stuff like yeah, it\u2019s just bad. So, in my own deficient understanding to the nasties of mainstream hair de-frizzifiers and face creams, I thought, hmm\u2026 I bet there are a lot of people who feel the same way about the \u201cnew\u201d language about food that dangles from posters and is tagged on egg cartons throughout the grocery store. I sorta have a hunch that most people hear and see and recognize trending terms without knowing what they truly, fully mean. There is so much vernacular thrown around these days in the movement toward greater food consciousness and I think can get pretty intimidating for the layperson who is trying to figure out what is \u201chealthy.\u201d So here\u2019s the skinny\u2026 I\u2019ve compiled a baker\u2019s dozen of popular labels/terms to help you navigate the supermarket, and to combat any misperception you may find in dialogue with family and friends. Oh, and it\u2019s kinda a long list. Totally geeked-out over this. I don\u2019t expect you to read through the whole thing; maybe  poke around, pick a term, and take it with you knowing this post will be here to help on an as-need basis. Fair Trade:  Products that bear a Fair Trade logo come from farmers and workers who are justly compensated. Fair Trade USA, the most popular organization to label goods like sugar, coffee, bananas, grains, etc. helps farmers in developing countries build sustainable businesses that positively influence their communities. Fair Trade labeling indicates that the product has been grown, harvested, and produced within a disadvantaged international community that is taking ownership of the free market. Check out these sick videos to learn more  here , and  here , as well as this NY Times  article  that critiques the practice. All Natural:  Marketing ploy, all the way. The FDA actually has no definition for what \u201cnatural\u201d actually means, so companies are free to label things \u201cnatural\u201d as long as they don\u2019t contain synthetic substances. Let\u2019s compare a box of Cheerios to say, a sweet potato. Which one is actually natural? Well, the FDA says both. You shouldn\u2019t buy into that logic. Food labeling expert Urvashi Rangan says, \u201cthe natural claim is one of the most vague and misleading green claims that we see out on the marketplace.\u201d Check out  this 90 sec clip  featuring Marion Nestle on the \u201cAll-Natural\u201d scam. Cage-Free:  Unfortunately, this label conjures a vision of chickens dancing about in an open green pasture eating worms and loving life when, in reality, cage-free just designates that chickens were not raised in high-density battery cages. According to  Good.is , \u201cBy U.S. Department of Agriculture standards, hens that lay certified organic eggs must be given access to the outdoors. But even for this more-stringent label, there are no specifications on time and duration of outdoor access. Some \u201corganic\u201d producers might get their birds outside once or twice in the animals\u2019 lives. It\u2019s a misleading practice that goes against everything that \u201ccage-free\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d ideals were created to represent.\u201d GMO / Non-GMO:  A genetically modified organism (GMO) or genetically engineered organism (GEO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These techniques, generally known as recombinant DNA technology, use DNA molecules from different sources, which are combined into one molecule to create a new set of genes that enhance desired traits such as increased resistance to herbicides, cold extreme temperatures, pests, disease, and drought. Right now, the FDA does not regulate or label GE incidence in food so where you see a Non-GMO label, it has been verified through a third-party audit. Check out  this mega James Bond-esque video  that explains more, and find out more about the push to label GE foods from the \u201c Just Label It\u201d  campaign. Gluten-Free:  Gluten is a protein that results when the proteins gliadin and glutenin join together with starch in the seed of grass-related grains such as wheat, rye, barley, durum, graham, semolina, spelt, farro, and kamut. Products labeled \u201cgluten-free\u201d mean it does not contain  any  gluten and is made with alternative grains such as rice, buckwheat, quinoa, sorghum, millet, and teff, or no grains at all. Gluten tends to cause inflammation in the gut that many people are sensitive to. In extreme cases where there is total gluten intolerance, a person may have Celiac Disease. The US Dept. of Health and Human Services estimates that 1 in 22 are affected. Check in with  Gluten Free Girl  for an amazing list of resources and further reading. rBST:  Recombinant bovine growth hormone (also known as rBGH) is a genetically engineered drug produced by the Monsanto Corporation. It\u2019s injected into dairy cows to induce them to increase milk production. About 1 in 5 US cows are given this hormone since it was approved by the FDA in 1993. rBST is linked to increased occurrence of mastitis a \u201cpersistent, inflammatory reaction of the udder tissue\u201d and can cause hormonal disturbances in humans who consume the milk from treated cows. Check out  this short interview  with Dr. Jenny Pompilio of the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility to hear a more in depth explanation. BPA / BPA-Free:  Bisphenol-A is a plastic and resin ingredient used to line metal food and drink cans, and it\u2019s a main building block for polycarbonate (PC) plastics. Even at low doses, Bisphenol A has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the  Environmental Working Group report  on BPA for more information. Look for cans labeled BPA-free like  Eden Organics  and re-usable water bottles made of steel like  Klean Kanteen Organic:  The USDA Organic label means produce and other ingredients are grown without the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms, or ionizing radiation. Animals that produce meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products do not take antibiotics or growth hormones. The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) defines organic as follows:  \u201c[crops] are produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance environmental quality for future generations. Before a product can be labeled \u201corganic,\u201d a Government-approved certifier inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA organic standards.\u201d  USDA certification is often arduous and expensive, meaning small farms that adhere to organic standards sometimes cannot afford to follow one or a few of the USDA\u2019s arbitrary guidelines. Talk to your farmers at the farmers market and ask about their practices. Pasteurized:  I think most people know what this means, but I put it on the list only because when I first moved to San Diego I was grocery shopping and overheard a few college kids debating what pasteurized meant in the dairy aisle. A girl about my age proclaimed, \u201cpasteurized means they get to walk around in a pasture and eat grass.\u201d No, I\u2019m not joking. She really said that. Pasteurization is actually the process of heating food to a set temperature for a set amount of time and cooling it to slow spoilage and reduce microbial growth in the food. Wild Caught /  Sustainably Farmed:  You\u2019ll find labels like this at the seafood counter. Wild Caught may seem pretty self explanatory,  but turns out that the modes of \u201ccatch in the wild\u201d can be pretty brutal. In some cases fishing methods such as dynamiting reefs, high-seas bottom-trawling, and drift nets are used in the open ocean. On the bright side,  \u201dwild-caught can also encompass more desirable lower-impact techniques, such as hand-lines, divers, or the use of pots or traps\u201d according to the  Huffington Post.  Because of over-harvesting and pollution, a new technique of fish-farming is booming. Farmed fish generally gets a bad rap (and for good reason, some farms feed their salmon corn\u2026 um, yeah?) but Seafood Watch has done the hard work for you in compiling updated lists of what seafood is best for the environment and your health. Check out their  super-awesome smartphone App  or  print a nifty guide  tailored to your region and stick it in your wallet. CSA / Local:  Local is relative to the distance between food producers and consumers. \u201cLocal\u201d labeling often identifies when certain products are grown, or produced within an 100-mile radius of purchase. Traditionally, Community Supported Agriculture programs require membership to a certain farm where individuals buy a share of the farm at the beginning of the growing season to \u201cprovide farmers with up-front capital to grown and manage the farm in exchange for weekly delivery of fresh, seasonal produce.\u201d Today, farms also collaborate with local co-operatives where consumers can find seasonal goods within a supermarket-like setting. See more on the changing nature of the CSA via  NPR This recipe was created for the Wisconsin Cheese Council and their quirky-cute \u201c Grilled Cheese Academy .\u201d Check out the video how-to of this sandwich and the creations of Sara Forte / Sprouted Kitchen and Ashley Rodriguez / Not Without Salt  here . Shaun shot the footage, which as then edited by an outside party. **We were compensated for the creation of this recipe, which, is a mega-helpful contribution to the post-grad piggy bank.

VPreheat the oven for 450.\u2019 Remove the greens from the carrots and reserve for later use. Place on a heavy baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Cook for 20 minutes until they just begin to brown and blister. For the carrot top pesto, place washed greens in the basin of a food processor with the blade attachment. Combine olive oil, garlic, and the juice of one lemon. Blitz until smooth, adding a little olive oil if it feels too \u201cpulp-y.\u201d Shave the cheese super thin, set aside.\u000a
p778
aVWarm a shallow, heavy pan over medium heat while you prepare the sandwiches. Butter one side of each slice of bread. Lay flat and layer with cheese, then pesto, then 4-5 grilled carrots. It\u2019s okay if the stems stick out. Finish with another layer of cheese, if desired, and the other slice of bread.

VOh Rhubarb, are you enjoying your day in the sun? Everyone is out on the weekend dancing to the banjo man at the farmers markets, celebrating Spring. You\u2019re not the one we\u2019ve been holding out for, but you put up a good fight, so gallant and lanky amidst the new and delicate green, never apologizing for your tartness or your withered nobs. Your arrival in the stalls and tents signals that winter has finally gone to rest and that there are so many good, new things to come. I\u2019ve taken some notes from you this season, notes on  owning it . Not being bossy. Not being prideful. You just show up as you  are . Like,  hey, I\u2019m not strawberries, but that\u2019s cool that\u2019s not what I want to be.  Folks are like  WTF  sometimes when you gawk about too close to the beets and fennel but you shake it off, you already know that the ones who see your potential are who you want to take you home anyway. Those special folks gussy you up, simmer you down, muddle you with booze, coat you in sugar and butter. You end up really getting the royal treatment when it\u2019s all said and done. You won\u2019t be around much longer, Rhubarb. Basil and summer squash will burst onto the scene and most will forget you. I won\u2019t. I\u2019m going to think of you all summer. Owning it. Loving it. Not trying to fight any of it. Showing up and being real. I will try my best to just come as I am, what do you think?  That\u2019s all one can really hope to do in this life, right? Sincerely, Kelsey Actual vanilla bean is clutch for this recipe. Extract won\u2019t suffice. Treat yourself.

VI knew we were in the final stretch today while in the market I picked up a bag of garbanzo bean flour and actually hesitated, wondering,  will I be able to use all of this by the end of May?  As I write this, Shaun is taking pictures of a surfboard and an old printer for craigslist. At the front door there is a bankers box of pots, glasses, and towels for goodwill that we\u2019ve somehow accumulated over the past few years. Books are stacked for sorting, graduation announcements strewn about the table waiting for stamps. By now it\u2019s probably a good time to tell; we\u2019re moving to Colorado. The Mountains are calling. We\u2019re going where our heart is, not where we think it \u201cshould\u201d be. And that feels so darn great. Many of you have been trying to trace our steps since January, and I should give you all gold stars for your patience as I danced around in circles making and un-making up my mind. Brooklyn? DC? Portland? San Francisco? Denver? It has been a long, tiresome, soul-stretching process. Shaun and I honored it, and each other, by digging through the thicket privately. But there is more\u2026 \u2026 since (most of) the whirlwind has subsided, it\u2019s time to let everyone in again. We\u2019re going to Colorado, and in a way you\u2019re coming too (!!). To that, I have to stop and say thank you. Your love, encouragement, and wisdom has enriched my life in more ways than I could possibly put into words. This whole blog thing completely blows my mind. I\u2019ve probably been more vulnerable with you, in this space, than I have ever been with some of the people I call friends in real life. How is that? How does that happen? I think I\u2019m still figuring it all out. Thank you for coming into my life with your unique perspective and light, week after week, and thank you for letting me into yours. This is the wonder that\u2019s keeping the stars apart. I carry your heart, I carry it in my heart.  (e.e cummings) Here\u2019s the thing. If you have an hour to kill on Sunday afternoon, try the pasta yourself. But because I love you, because I carry your heart with me in my heart, I urge you to take some shorcuts here. How do I put this lightly, gluten free pasta is\u2026 frustrating to work with. Time. Patience. Practice. I set out to make fettucine, but failed miserably. Determined to not let the dough go to waste I made bows, instead. The first batch was too thick, but on second go, I got a great size and texture. If you\u2019re feeling gutsy, try it. I love the nutty taste of chickpea pasta, but I think whole wheat spaghetti, brown rice shells, or any other type of pasta would go brilliantly with the lemony, herby peas.

VFor the pasta, add the flour to a large bowl, making a well in the middle for the eggs. Crack eggs and slowly begin to whisk with a fork, incorporating the flour until you get a shaggy ball. Add a little water to pull together the scraps. Turn out onto a ULTRA floured surface (on the first go, I went straight onto the cutting board, bad idea, second go, I used an old silicon mat underneath the flour to prevent sticking). Roll out until 1-2 mm thickness.  Cut vertical strips, 1/2 inch thick, then cut horizontally every 2 inches until you have made small rectangles. They should look like stubby, short sticks of gum. Pinch at the center of rectangle on the long-side to create the bow.  Set aside. Repeat. Bring large pot of water to boil. Cook in small batches for 2-4 minutes.\u000a

VMarch 17th last year was day three of our ten day trek on the Torres del Paine circuit. Some of you weren\u2019t with us last year when we took a hiatus to Patagonia, Chile. I made  Pisco Sours  when we came home. In any case, we had put in 20km that day and looked ahead at a challenging summit early the next morning. Shaun made camp by the lake of Los Perros Glacier, pitching the tent as I propped up my swollen feet against the tree from where I started putting up the hammock and stopped halfway. I draped the hanging portion of the hammock over my face and listened to the moaning and creaking of the glacier, waiting every 15 minutes or so to hear large, school bus sized chunks of ice dislodge and crash into the water below. Shaun came over to where I lay comatose and finished my hammock job. I crawled in and tried not to think about food. We had underestimated our calorie needs for the trek and were on a tight ration of freeze-dried meals, oatmeal, and cliff bars for the remaining 100 kilometers. The two books and journal I had brought haunted me. I would have given my left arm to have swapped them for a jar of peanut butter when we left the hostel in Puerto Natales four days prior. I rocked over on my right side in the hammock to survey the area as other hikers limped in for the night. A splattering of white sticks at the base of a tree at the next campsite over came into focus.  DEAR GOD, IS THAT SPAGHETTI?  With a sudden burst of energy I rolled out of the hammock and motioned for Shaun to join me at the base of the tree. Sure enough. Dried spaghetti exploded across the roots in the dirt as if someone yesterday had been standing there and ripped open the package too quickly. One by one we collected the pasta like a game of pick-up-sticks, careful to keep the larger pieces intact before delicately placing them  in my beanie. We crouched by our tent for an hour brushing off the dirt before boiling a pot of water, cooking it, and adding it to our allotted packet-meal for the night. That bizarre, desperate, and humbling moment is everything to me. It is the most mortifying and perfect reminder we often just need one person to be with us in the amber of the moment and bear witness to our existence. Someone to sit with us in the dirt after a long day to sort through the muck and pick up the pieces of our lives and make something good of it. A hug, a look, a gesture that silently says\u2026 I hear you, I see you, and I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m pretty psyched on the fact that the person who eats spaghetti from the forest floor with me in times of famine is the person I get to call partner and \u201chusband\u201d for the rest of my life. And if we\u2019re lucky enough to have a partner, sibling, parent, or friend who doesn\u2019t back away from the vulnerable, ugly, and often lopsided parts of our journey, we should be bold enough to say thank you loudly and often. There is no work more important, in my opinion, than to accept this love and learn to share it with as many people as we can muster. It is the only work to be done in this lifetime, really. We go through our years busy-ing ourselves with work and pleasure and community, yet despite it all, we still often feel so darn alone. We must reach for one another, constantly.  We have to try and crouch together, we have to try to laugh, to listen, to cry, to bear witness to each other\u2019s lives\u2026 they are affirmations to our humanity and our deep and fundamental longing to know and be known. I\u2019m pretty young in the scheme of things and probably don\u2019t know much about much, but this is what I believe: we were put here to hold on and hang in there, together. We\u2019re here to seek each other and support and try our merry best to humble ourselves to the madness that is being alive together at the same time, rolling the dice, getting creative with hands outstretched to make the best of the whole thing.

VIn a medium bowl, combine ricotta, herbs, lemon juice, egg and salt/pepper until thoroughly combined. Cover and place in the refrigerator.\u000a
p943
aVIn a large bowl or clean, flat work surface combine the flour with the salt, nutmeg and the 1 tablespoon of semolina. Create a well in the flour and crack eggs into it. Beat the eggs with a fork until smooth, drizzle with olive oil, then continue with your hands to mix the oil and eggs with the flour, incorporating a little at a time, until everything is combined. As Jamie Oliver says \u201cwith a bit of work and some love and attention they\u2019ll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough.\u201d Wrap the dough in plastic and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.\u000a
p944
aVCut the dough into 4 equal pieces and cover with plastic wrap while you work with one quarter at a time. Flatten the dough ball and dust with flour. Roll the dough through pasta machine at the widest setting. Fold the dough in thirds (like a letter), then run it through the machine at the same setting, folded edge first. Repeat the folding and rolling once more. Roll the dough through at successively narrower settings, two times per setting, until it is thin enough for you to see the outline of your hand through it. Lay the dough out on a work surface lightly dusted with flour and trip the edges so they are straight.\u000a
p945
aVFill a ziploc bag (or piping bag if you\u2019re fancy like that) with ricotta filling. Pipe filling across the bottom of the pasta sheet in a straight, even line. Pull the bottom edge of the pasta up and over the filling. \u000a
p946
aVSeal the agnolotti by carefully molding the pasta over the filling and pressing lightly with your index finger to seal the edge of the dough to the pasta sheet. Set aside, cover with a towel, and continue until you\u2019ve used up your dough. You will probably have filling leftover! Double the dough recipe or use the filling for later. \u000a
p947
aVIn a large saucepan, melt butter with lemon juice and olive oil over low-medium heat. Cook agnolotti in batches for 5 minutes at a time, using a spoon to drizzle pasta with hot liquid to cook evenly. Serve immediately with fresh herbs, pea shoots, and a bit of leftover Parmigiano-Reggiano\u000a

VThe rope that tethers me to this place, this time, is growing thinner with each day approaching the big move (42, who\u2019s counting).  Things feel different, everywhere. My running route, the struggle to find parking on campus, our favorite restaurants, the farmers market, even the beach. It\u2019s as if my mind has begun the emotional preparations for a new normal by disassociating from the old. More frequently now I find myself caught in the ordinary moments with a feeling of being there, but not really  there  in the ways I once was. I drive through parts of town and see the places I lost myself, the places I really found myself.  I see Shaun and I, younger, and the memories made in our relentless itch for growth and exploration. Everywhere there is a cacophony of light and dark, joy and pain, laughter and tears. It feels sorta supernatural. Hard to describe. Standing at the edge of the shore this morning, I looked up to the clouds barreling across the sky after the good storm we had the past few days and felt an extraordinary sense of gratitude for the time, for the place \u2014 for all that it gave, for all that it took away. Four years have come and gone. I\u2019m a different person now. I hope a better one. And it\u2019s time. Time to let new faces and new seasons to teach me more about myself, more about the world. The strawberries will be missed, California. But I\u2019m so ready for new adventures.

VWhen I start a copywriting assignment with a new client, the most important question I ask to get to know them is  \u201cwhere are you, what are you doing, and who are you with when you most feel like yourself?\u201d  They often smile, get a little quiet, and start to tell a story. Somewhere they visited, Saturday rituals at home\u2026 little details that reveal their personality and perspective. It\u2019s more anthropological experimentation than it is helpful writing tool. Often, how they answer this question is entirely different than the manner in which they answer all the others. They haven\u2019t prepared for this sort of prompt, so they have a chance to share in their sincerest form. How interesting is it that? Using the exercise on myself, I become overwhelmed with a deep and exhilarating sense of peace and understanding as I am instantly transported to a time and space where things were just as they should be. When I find myself drifting off course or am sorting through serious life decisions, I try to practice this mediation. It has a funny way of bringing my head and heart back into alignment when the wires get crossed or cut. I\u2019ve recently come to think of it as my \u201chappiness compass.\u201d  Ultimately, when we are able to live out the truest, most authentic versions of ourselves, we can be the most happy. I think so often we get caught up in  creating  an idea of happiness that we look too far outward, forward to things and elaborate ideas that will slingshot us out of a current state of fatigue, frustration, fear, etc. While I totally think happiness is something you can and should work to manifest, in times of uncertainty, it is best guided by the reminders living inside us all. Memories can\u2019t provide direct answers for our troubles, but the process of remembering may lull the voices, our own and otherwise, that may be pulling/pushing us into a direction that leaves us feeling unsettled. It creates space for us to truly consider all that we know to be true, trust all that is yet to be taught, and go forward with a sense of empowerment to just be. It brings everything back to center. There may be chaos, there may be distraction, there may be consternation\u2026 but in our own answer, there can be stillness. And that is enough.  So I ask  you  this question, today\u2026 Where are you, what are you doing, and who are you with when you most feel like yourself?\u201d  Close your eyes.  Listen . Let those places, people, spaces wash over you and fill you with love and light. Feel free to shred, julienne, or dice anything your heart desires for these guys \u2014 spring rolls are incredibly versatile. I\u2019ve mixed soft greens, crisp cabbage, and creamy avocado to diversify the texture. Add or subtract herbs as desired. Play with the sauce to your liking too, I spotted it in the magazine and knew it had potential. And\u2026 get this: Happyolks has a free app for iPhone. Um, What!? Speaking of things that remind us who we really are, my incredible/handsome/kind little brother spent the semester in one of his engineering courses developing it for us. Hugs to Austin for his hard work. Download it from the App Store and check for updates and new features as the year progresses.

VCombine 1 cup grits with 5 cups cold water in a heavy, deep pot. Bring to a boil, toss in a bit of salt and reduce to simmer for 45 minutes, stirring very frequently and adding water and oil/butter to your liking. Meanwhile, prep asparagus on baking sheet. Coat with olive oil, salt, pepper and zest of 1 lemon. Broil on the top rack for no more than 5 minutes. Remove asparagus from pan and set aside. Slice the white and light green portion of both garlic and onions and toss in leftover olive oil from the asparagus on the baking sheet. Squeeze the juice of the fully zested lemon over the garlic and onions. Add a bit more oil if you feel necessary. Return to the broiler, and check every 2 minutes to make sure they don\u2019t burn. Pull them out when they have a nice brown char on the edges. Set aside.\u000a

VI feel like I\u2019ve been awkwardly bumbling about here the last few weeks. Stalling. Filling the white space up with words that I can justify clicking the publish button with, but void of the kind of truth or vulnerability that I usually challenge myself to share in this space. It\u2019s all part of the process, though. I think. I hope.  Still learning what it means to be on the web like this. While it excites me that there actually people (like you) who tune in each week to this nook, it is also sort of presses on that weak spot in my psyche that is constantly egging on to \u201cbe perfect.\u201d Ugly business. You know, the virus of  \u201dshould be, should say, should do\u201d that holds us all back from being our best, truest possible selves. Every so often when I get down to business writing here, I get stuck on an idea where it\u2019s like,  rats , I can\u2019t say  that  or I can\u2019t talk about  this  because I don\u2019t want to offend or upset someone. There is a quiet nagging voice warning: \u201cmust be poised, must be calm, must be wise, must not ruffle too many feathers.\u201d And okay, to a certain degree the conscientiousness is good \u2013 even necessary. The world would be a much nicer place if we all just learned to check ourselves now and then when we have an outrageously passionate thought. But too much editing, filtering, and accommodating makes me feel like a robot. Yet, as it were, this week I did not feel calm. I did not feel rational. I did not feel yogic. So many things that made me want to light the kitchen on fire, really. There was not a stable emotion to cling to for more than a few hours as I boomeranged between elation, empowerment, anger, sadness, frustration, confusion, joy, and crushing heartbreak. I chopped off 10 inches of hair on Tuesday with unabashed lightness, yet on Friday my chest was so heavy with sorrow for all the suffering, depravity, and cruelty of this world that I could barely stand as Shaun held me in his arms. A mess I tell you; imagine me later over a cutting board shouting \u201cSociety, Society!\u201d at the top of my lungs with a clenched fist of radishes just  like Eric McAndless  from the film  Into The Wild  when an article on Texas abortion laws push it all over the edge Crazy person, crazy. I have a food blog. We take pretty pictures and share healthy recipes. That\u2019s nice. Sweet. But on the other side of the editing table is an intense passion for \u201cstuff\u201d other than vegetables that floods my veins with purpose, intention, and deep conviction. The perfection trap can\u2019t even put up a fight today because  right now my heart is too swollen, my spirit soggy with the weight of a million weary voices and divisive ideologies that I alone cannot bring together or make better. There is a lot I really, really don\u2019t understand about the world right now. I\u2019ll keep kicking here, but it\u2019s hard to profess my great love for salad in this state. So I suppose I\u2019ll stall a bit more. Stalling with grace, hopefully. It\u2019s what I\u2019m holding onto through all of this and I think you should too, whatever it is you see in the world,  your  world, that concerns  you . Grace is everywhere in everything. Grace during moments of distress. Grace for times of great joy. Grace through the angst. Grace in failure. Grace for the good fight. Grace for the radish-rants in the kitchen. Grace for the people and ideas and things we don\u2019t understand. Lets just have some grace, sound good?

V\u201cIf you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don\u2019t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that\u2019s often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don\u2019t be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb. (Don\u2019t Hesitate)\u201d \u2015 Mary Oliver,  Swan: Poems and Prose Poems

VWe sat on the runway together this morning, looking out the window to a city that doesn\u2019t yet feel like home but beckons us both in ways we don\u2019t really understand yet. Deep breath.  Is this it? Is this the next step?  The \u201cwhat ifs\u201d the \u201cyeah, buts\u201d drown out the emergency evacuation tutorial and screaming children behind us. Inside I feel ashamed of my insecurities around the whole thing, but I try to remind that these feeling are, in fact, quite normal. It occurs to me somewhere between Baltimore and Chicago that whatever happens, wherever we go from here, the fact that we\u2019ll be going, doing, succeeding, and failing  together  is enough to keep me from losing my lunch. When I find myself in moments of relative panic, I bring together all the absurdly supportive people in my life into vision, and borrow some of their love and light to lock-up the monkey that has become of my mind. This weekend especially, I think of Shaun. I love that despite the fact we\u2019ve been together for six+ years, Shaun still says things that surprise the heck out of me. Little phrases that come out of nowhere that make me find him even more charming than when we first met. \u201cLet\u2019s winterize this place,\u201d he exclaimed last week, slapping his hands together and going on a window-locking spree around the apartment. Sweet nothings aren\u2019t much for me. He knows better than to buy roses from South America. I feel more connected when we\u2019re both sitting at the kitchen island in our sweaty running garb eating eggs and avocado and scratching out budgets for the big road-trip come June on a water-warped legal pad. Shaun only buys red sharpies for some reason, and when he holds the cap in his mouth, adjudicating that we\u2019ll need a cooler in the car for my homemade nut milk and allocating funds for fresh vegetables along the way, I know there is no one on this planet who I would want to climb a mountain or jump the cliff with. We (humans, partners, friends, family) take turns carrying each other, cheering each other on along the journey. We prop each other up when things feel soggy, sick, or scary. I think most of the time, we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re doing it for one another either. When you become so close, so connected to someone it\u2019s like the dance starts happening on its own and the very nature of our being can be enough to shed light, comfort, or set straight. Seeing Shaun hunched over Southwest Soduku, oddly, does just that for me. When we\u2019re open to it, the innoncence and predictability of what might appear quite mundane can be enough to tickle us pink and shake away the dark parts of the big mystery. Our future destinations and any call to action seems so vast and unknown, except for each other. There will be great changes, but there will be great love. When everything feels like it doesn\u2019t make sense, there will be red sharpies, and we will have one another to hold and tease and carry each other through.  Exhale . It\u2019s going to be a great ride. Before deciding on this recipe for a blog post this week, I had no idea that I would be consuming so many potatoes over the next few days after. In fact, every amazing dinner and rich conversation that we spent with Shaun\u2019s brother Cody and his love, Michelle, involved some variation on the nightshade. So it seems this post turns into my \u2018ode to the potato and how it somehow became the conduit for so much good energy, so much love. Heidi uses mustard, tarragon, capers, parsley and a few other goodies in the original recipe. This may be a watered-down rendition, but delicious nonetheless.

V\u201cWe do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations.\u201d \u2014    Anais Nin Spicy Potato Tarragon Soup  It\u2019s still winter here in Colorado, although spring is introducing itself in fits and starts. I\u2019m considering this my last homage to the hearty, sustaining bowls of warmth that have characterized this  amazing season of snow and festivity  Savor the crumbs of cold that are left for us, folks. Everyone seems to want to be in the season that\u2019s in front of them instead of celebrating the one that\u2019s here, now. It will be time for tulips, asparagus, and rhubarb soon enough.

VWe\u2019re scraping together some semblances of rhythm and routine around these parts. Week to week, there is almost nothing that resembles our old life in San Diego let alone the day we cut a check for the new lease. I just rolled the dice in June and haven\u2019t stopped throwing them up to the sky since. There have been a few Sunday mornings reading the Times, cutting out articles that inspire over a hearty breakfast and a few cups of coffee, but haven\u2019t exactly found that same sort of grounding consistency of days past that puts our souls at ease. No complaints, none at all. Just an observation. All summer long we\u2019ve bounced around the country and this new place rounding up jobs and memories. Not busy, just full. I might be maxing out on stimulation here, the months of activity and new-ness since our move is starting to catch up with me I think. I feel it in my knees. I see it under my eyes. I anticipate (I hope) that when Autumn arrives at the end of the month we will have found or created some balance for our weeks. There was time for a bit of cake this weekend. Oh, and a  glacier . That was nice. And so were your comments from the last post. Boy, just floating on all that love and good energy. Thanks guys.

Fold in flour mixture to liquid one cup at a time, stirring lightly until just blended. Grease bundt pan with coconut oil or butter, dusting with flour to coat and prevent sticking. Pour in batter slowly and distribute evenly. Bake for 45-55 minutes until it passes the toothpick test. Let the cake cool for 30 minutes before trying to remove. TRUST.\u000a

VMy favorite view in Colorado can be seen through our North-facing upstairs bathroom window. In the morning, when it has snowed overnight, I sit on the counter and press my left cheek against the cold pane to watch the colors change to the East as the sun rises over white roofs and lawns. Snow, I have discovered recently, has the same sort of reverent, sweeping effect on my spirit that the ocean once had. It is snowing now as I write this from the bathroom and if I\u2019m lucky it will stick through the morning. Shaun is on a work trip  for a few days and seeing that I have the day off tomorrow, and to myself, I will make a pilgrammage to the park and make snow angels again along the running path for the walkers and runners and lovers. They are strangers whose lives I will never know yet somehow always know. For the beautiful, radiant young souls who were taken from this earthplane too soon, I will lay my head back in the snow, next to my angels, your sweet too young angels, and look to the sky to say thank-you a million times for my full and undeserving life. I will blow out my candles for each of you next week with tears in my eyes for every painful, awkward, surprising, perfect moment I have been given and you have been robbed. \u201cI closed the box and put it in a closet. There is no real way to deal with everything we lose.\u201d \u2015 Joan Didion,  Where I Was From

VWhen the moon is out and fog hugs the city limits, the trails of airplanes \u2014 the steam, smoke, whatever it is they leave behind \u2014 appears black against the night sky. Have you seen this before? It\u2019s stunning. Haunting. Driving home from the movies a few nights ago, I motioned to Shaun to pull over and look at the moon in this state, the way the black line lingering up there in the sky divided it in two. We parked the car in front a dark driveway and stared, silently. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s an asteroid headed for Earth?\u201d I asked. Shaun laughed, \u201cI think it\u2019s a plane, and, I think you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d It is December now, and I am reminded by the twinkling lights on houses that guide my bike rides home at night that life can be messy and confusing and still be knock-your-socks-off-magnificent. My life is so abundant, fuller and richer than any young woman could possibly deserve in a lifetime. Tough days seem selfish, trite, ignorant. I wake some nights gasping for breath, stunned at my blessings and overwhelmed with a sense of duty to repay the world with duplicate affection for all it has given me. A new friend asked me the other day, \u201cseems like you\u2019e working too hard at this stuff, is it all worth fighting for?\u201d The answer was (and is) YES. Yes and always yes. The good is always worth fighting for. There isn\u2019t much I feel like I know for sure about this world but this, fighting for the good stuff, I can assure. The moments parked in front of dark driveways discussing asteroids and planes and the moon and love and life and death and who we are and why we\u2019re here and how desperately we just want to do it right \u2013 these moments will always be worth fighting for.

VThere were fleas. Millions, it seemed. They loved my ankles. I suppose the outbreak was the last farewell from the foster dogs of winter and spring who nestled under our bed on the blankets from Morocco. We dragged every single modality of fabric from our house to the industrial washers up the road and watched the pesks drown in the suds while eating pizza by-the-slice and studying French verb conjugations on the linoleum. A grizzly looking man in worn denim took laps around the dryers selling yellow squash and strawberries from a wagon. Nancy Grace blared from a mounted television in the corner.  Where had the time gone?  A few years ago we spent every weekend at this laundromat playing out the same routine (sans fleas), dumping out the stink and work of our week and sorting it with the rest of the neighborhood. We felt like real \u201cgrown-ups\u201d with our  own  washer and dryer when we moved to this place a year ago, the one we will say goodbye to in 10 days. Ten. In ten days I will have packed the car, thrown the tasseled cap, and baked through the last of the flour in the freezer. We\u2019ll hand over the keys and take I-5 North for the last time, waving goodbye with big, big smiles to the coast that has truly held me together in more ways I could possibly repay it for. We\u2019ll come back again, one day, but not soon. Not like this. Folding the sheets, I hmmmm\u2019d at Shaun\u2026  \u201dI think we need to do one more post before we leave.\u201d  Oatmeal seemed like a strange note to end on here. Of course, the saint that he is, agreed to whatever, whenever. Between the last exams, last bike rides, last get-togethers, last trips to goodwill\u2026 I wanted there to be tacos. Yellow squash seemed appropriate. And I wanted there to be music.  I made you a mix  to listen to while you make these. Songs from my story, our story, songs that maybe can become a part of yours. Sometimes I think a few minutes of lyric and instrument can say more about the swells of emotion that rise and fall during times like these better than I possibly could. This is it folks. This is where the good stuff is. Swimming it all right now, arms stretched wide, lapping up the last bits of sweetness from this bowl of lessons. I feel it coming. Newness. So, so Happy. Ready.

VIt\u2019s 2 am and I just ate the last piece of molasses cake leftover from the New Years Eve gathering we hosted a few days ago. I never saw anyone eat a slice, but the next morning I found the bundt half gone on it\u2019s stand, covered by a dish towel. I like that people can expect a treat when they\u2019re at the house. I\u2019m often asked  why  I cook and my answer has evolved and simplified over time: to love, to nourish. It\u2019s a small thing, on my list of big things, of ways to say I love you. In any case, there is a vent beneath the counter that warms a patch of tile on the kitchen floor and I stood on it, camped out in my bare feet, eating, listening to the creaks of the house and sorting through a stack of mail beside me. I turn over what appears to be a credit card offer and start scribbling a shopping list. Cauliflower. Horseradish. Greens. Coffee beans (!). Chemex filters (!!!!!).  Toothpaste. Chocolate chips. Goat\u2019s Gouda. Dates. I love January and it\u2019s everyday-ness. I\u2019m glad for a regular pulse again. The holidays are great but it\u2019s the stillness that I crave at the end of it all. We took our little evergreen out to the curb promptly when we returned from California and I filled the house with white ranunculus and put my Dad\u2019s Neil Young album, Harvest, on our new record player to fill the house with something\u2026 normal. New Years resolutions have never been my bag. Not on the 1st, at least. I want to cover my ears, close my eyes, and shout la la la la la la la la la la la when \u201cgoals for 2014\u2033 comes up in social conversations because here\u2019s the deal: A new year starts whenever I say it starts. You guys know me, I\u2019ll preach intentionality \u2019til I\u2019m blue in the face, but, erase the numbers on the calendar and the year restarts fifty times, even one hundred times in 365 days, if we want it to. I like the idea of resolving and revising my life, intentions, goals, and boundaries throughout the entirety of the year.  My blueprints look nothing like they did a month ago, and I\u2019d wager they\u2019ll look different next month. Without grandeur or pomp or circumstance, there are always occasions that beg a breaking down and rebuilding the foundation. Fate and free will do their dance, and we are presented with, or choose, change. That\u2019s the beauty of this human life we get to live here on planet earth. We get to revise. We get to shift lanes. We can stop what we\u2019re doing at any point of the day, month, year and say  hey, you know, I think I\u2019m going to to try doing things differently from here out.  We are constantly being called to look in and look out at they way we treat people, how we  spend our time, how we think about ourselves, and the respect we show our bodies and our planet. Instead of cramming in all that self-reflection and goal setting for the sparkling brevity of a ball-drop, I\u2019d ask you to consider celebrating a new year, a new you, whenever you can. And those days are worth celebrating. The Thursday in March where you wake up, put your feet on the floor, and say to yourself:  today will be different, today I will\u2026  (fill in the blank)\u2026  that\u2019s gold right there. There will be no confetti or champagne. But it will be perfect, and you did it all on your own. Happy New Year, today, and every day. Shiitake Bok Choy Dumplings It\u2019s cold out! If you live in a winter-y climate, skip the juice fast and feed your Qi with warming, nourishing foods. My acupuncturist, Anna, says it\u2019s an order.  For the wonton sheets\u2026 I could only get my hands on the itty-bitty variety, which, if you have fingers that aren\u2019t on the dainty side like me, folding can be a bit of a challenge (albeit a worthy one). If you can find wrappers that are bigger, i.e. 3x3in,  I\u2019d suggest doubling the filling for this recipe.

VGet the sauce out of the way: Combine ingredients (except for cornstarch and orange zest) in a saucepan on medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in cornstarch and zest last then remove from heat.\u000a
p1785
aVFor the dumpling filling: chop boy choy, shiitakes, chives and carrots into very small pieces. Using a microplane grater, shave garlic, ginger, and orange zest into the vegetables and mix together. Warm sesame oil over medium heat in a pot or sauté pan. Add vegetable mixture and the tamari and stir to soften for no more than 5 minutes. The veggies should be vibrant and al dente.\u000a
p1786
aVAssemble the dumplings by placing one sheet on a flat surface. With a bowl of water near your dominant hand, dip a finger or two in the water and wet the perimeter of the dumpling so when you fold it all up it will stick together.  Place 1 heaping tablespoon of cooked filling in the center and fold together by adjoining the two opposite corners with a pinch and then repeating with the remaining corners, sealing the edges together as you go like a present. If your wonton wrappers are circular, you can see detailed instructions on how to assemble here. Repeat until all filling has been used.\u000a

VSummer storms are a new indulgence for me. Cozied in a reading chair by our front window I tend to my journal and a cup of cold tea. Torrents of rain bear down on the front walk and I visualize a release of stagnant memories, ideas, and beliefs being carried down the road with the leaves to the storm drain. Shaun is in the Domincan Republic, filming, and I sit alone, silent at my perch, letting the explosive energy of the passing thunder reverberate in my bones. Thoughts pass, yet nothing lingers. I experience an excess of calm amidst the raging weather and am reminded, again, of my smallness. I am a speck of matter and energy in this massive, bursting earthplane of people, places and dreams. During my months living at sea, I used to spend hours gazing upon the open ocean, begging the waves to teach me their humility and sense of time. Years later, in this chair and the throes of a summer storm, no begging is needed. I am both humbled and grateful for the gift of an unrushed hour to my afternoon. Tears form, then a smile. For the first time in a long time, I actually believe it will all be  okay.  Tomorrow my morning walk will smell of fresh ideas, resolve, and renewed opportunity, the rain will have cleansed the world of todays mistakes and made space for all that can, and will, come next. Exhale. // july 6

VWe need more storms. The garden loves it and so does my spirit. When dark clouds build out West over the mountains I put a kettle on for afternoon coffee, throw open all the downstairs windows, and ready my reading chair with a book. Elizabeth Gilbert shared once in a TED talk how early cultures believed they had a genius, \u201ca divine spirit that came from a distant and unknowable source,\u201d that waited to pounce on people with \u201cmoments of brilliance\u2026 showing them new ways of doing things, bestowing new songs to their ears.\u201d Gilbert described how the poet Ruth Stone often could look out, standing on the farm, and see a poem come barreling toward her over the landscape. It was chasing her, and she had to get up and run, as fast as she could, back to the house before it passed through her, blowing onward to find another poet. Ideas don\u2019t always come sweeping over me with genius or brilliance or poetry, but I have found that if I sit and be present to a good storm, the thunder can shake loose new perspective in my heart that I usually need urgently, badly. Like Ruth, I have to be diligent and be waiting in the ready to capture that perspective fully. And so, last week, I found myself  wrapped in an old blanket in my reading nook, and tried surrendering to the energy of the storm. I was distracted about an earlier email from a reader that had left me unsettled and self-conscious about where I find myself pivoting from in this point of life. I know she meant well, truly, but her advice was somewhat bruising. I acknowledge and accept that by publishing parts of my life for the world to read, I make myself open to judgement and critique \u2014 both of which happen so rarely I feel silly even bringing it up \u2014 but it does reflect on the tricky business of having a blog. We, as writers, may feel a distinct and coherent story building month to month, year to year, but most often what our readers experience are \u201cal a carte\u201d moments, snippets of this phase and that. We, me, you, don\u2019t always get the full picture. We can\u2019t. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not supposed to work like that. All that we are and all we believe cannot be packaged and delivered consistently in 1,000 words or less, so we chapter it all out, and continue, in earnest, to practice non-attachment and patience with those we invite into our lives (and living online spaces) \u2014 lives that are very much in-progress and under construction. This experience, of course, is magnified 10x in the flesh with strangers and friends and those we share toothpaste. But anyway\u2026 My point in sharing this singular, harmless experience with a reader is to spotlight how, gulp, I too sometimes walk dangerously into the book of someone elses life, mid-chapter, and assume a level of authority or perspective based on the information I think I\u2019m bearing witness to.  Por ejemplo\u2026  Shaun and I have friends who have recently separated after a year of marriage and honestly I\u2019ve been terribly hung up about it. Not about the divorce at large \u2014 as I don\u2019t believe destinies or soulmates to be fixed things \u2014 but just about the loss on an energetic level for  all  of us young folk in love, angsty, and in becoming. There is a sense of sadness and realization on the whole, in life, not all good fights can be won\u2026 and it kinda blows. I look at these friends falling apart and see ALL of us falling apart, as we do, as we grow as individuals and in partnership and community.  \u201cNo!!!\u201d  This was my knee-jerk reaction. Don\u2019t let it break! WORK like fucking hell, friends! Relationships are hard!\u201d  It wasn\u2019t until shaking the dust of that earlier email that I really realized how my consternation about the situation is entirely related to my own heart, my own struggles, and how when I look at these two beautiful people, wishing so desperately that \u201cit all\u201d could be fixed, I\u2019m really just seeing the ways I want to fix myself. A bit of  nemesism , really. And we do this, as humans, so often. We try to fix people as we would like to fix ourselves. We see our own lives mirrored back to us in the lives and choices and pain of others. We want them to be okay, we NEED them to be okay so we can be okay, too. We see only what we see. Every day we get the opportunity to observe and take part in the lives of others, in the middle of their perfect and un-perfect chapters, with our opinions, often well-intentioned, knowing only what we know. I think it\u2019s important, every single day, to try and step back and ask ourselves how much of our experiences with others are projections of our own desires, expectations, attachments. We have to remember that nothing needs fixing. We were put here to love, and that\u2019s pretty much it. So here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Let\u2019s all make a pact and try, really hard, to check our attachments at the door when experiencing the journey of another. It\u2019s going to be hard. I know. Especially because half the time we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re caught up in the first place. Let\u2019s try not to fill in the gaps for them. Not try to play out the before and after. Let\u2019s just be with people, where they are, and love them, without judgement. Let\u2019s be real with ourselves and recognize when and how and why we get caught up in the compulsion to mend. That\u2019s where the genius is, people. Storm or not. Let it barrel on.

VOh, baby. Last week I was an emotional and professional doozy. Without getting into specifics, I can honestly say that I have never felt more tested to dig deep, set my ego on the shelf, and be the person of (strength, character, restraint, kindness) I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve been practicing for since I joined the human race on December 26, 1989. On Wednesday the kitchen had no appeal whatsoever, so we headed out for dinner at a restaurant that was probably a bit indulgent for two kids in Nikes, bad hair, and puffy jackets but, it\u2019s Colorado, and the rising full moon begged us to release a bit of hardness and practice self care.   On this night, care came in the form of fancy kohlrabi salad, grilled octopus, and two glasses of wine\u2026 all of which we probably couldn\u2019t quite afford at the moment but felt so necessary to our existence that it didn\u2019t even matter. At one point I looked at Shaun and said, I love this  \u201cThis\u201d not being eating out, but the day, the moment, the fact that we were laughing and crying and so full and so empty all at the once. I started to well up with happy tears because of how ridiculously good everything felt (being alive, earning a right to sit across from each other at the table like this) despite the enormity of my exhaustion and general feelings of sweet-baby-jesus-this-life-business-ain\u2019t-for the birds that hovered about. As we age I imagine our daily struggles will wear different shoes, and the lessons we\u2019re served will get harder and and somehow easier\u2026 but I also have to believe that in those future years we will look back on days like these and think:  they were everything These early days reaching and scraping and believing we can make something good of our lives are so brutal sometimes, but also so intensely rich. I can only hope that in ten, twenty, forty years we\u2019ll be this resilient, this passionate. I can only hope we\u2019ll be this feisty, foolish, and humbled in our smallness. I can only hope we\u2019ll love how deeply we loved, how bad we royally fucked things up, how hard we tried, and how explicit we were in our search for opportunities to be better. \u201cHere we are, trapped in the amber of the moment. There is no why.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut Late Winter Chocolate and Orange Tart A few disclaimers before you make a go of it. I\u2019ll call this a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d recipe because it does take a bit longer than most of the recipes I share. Not that it  should  be reserved only for special occasions, but, you get what I mean. Also, for aesthetics, I did not remove the peel or pith of the oranges. Some people aren\u2019t into the bitterness, so I\u2019d suggest  supreming  or removing the rind of your fruit before dressing the tart.

aVWarm the milk in a saucepan until it begins to steam, not boil. In a medium bowl stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add egg yolks. Whisking them together will create a crumbly-paste like mixture. This is totally normal. Pour warm milk from the saucepan into the bowl of egg-flour paste and store together. Once everything has combined, return mixture to the saucepan over medium heat. WHISK CONSISTENTLY. You will feel like you\u2019re creating a ton of froth, but that\u2019s okay, it will begin to thicken after a few minutes. Pause whisking after three minutes and see if it begins to boil, if so, remove from heat.\u000a

VHere\u2019s a quick and dirty way to make ultra-clumpy granola: stand mixer. I discovered the technique on a rushed morning while juggling fifteen balls before for a camping trip to the mountains. Mix together all wet ingredients and bananas until you get a thick, chunky liquid. Add oats and let the machine run on medium-high for a few minutes before adding the hemp seeds. Scrape the sides as needed until everything is well-coated and clumping.\u000a
p2104
aVTurn out and spread granola onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes at 400\u2032 F. Check at around 20 minutes and turn over with a spatula or wooden spoon to evenly brown everything up. Let cool for 30 minutes before storing. We enjoyed it camping fireside with greek yogurt the next day.\u000a

VThe mouse is dead. I repeat, the mouse that has occupied my kitchen for the past four months has finally cycled into another existence, hopefully as a squirrel or more savory varmint far away from this address. A few nights ago Shaun and I were laying in bed, almost asleep, when we were startled by the sound of crinkling, crackling, and nibbling in the office. The office, I\u2019m telling you, which is upstairs and about a million Shaun-sized paces from the kitchen. I jumped out of bed and barreled down the hall in my underwear, shaking my hands in the air hollering \u201cMark my words, this is it! (expletives) This is your last night!\u201d I reloaded and repositioned every  trap in the living room, dining room, and kitchen with gobs of peanut butter and brie (as it was suggested, a Happyolks mouse might have advanced taste). At work the next day I got a two word text message from Shaun around 3 pm, \u201cGot him,\u201d two glorious day-making words, and I proceeded to gloat to every co-worker who had been following my persistent rodent woes since October.  Do not cross a girl chasing a mouse in her underwear. She means business. You see, it\u2019s finally a new year now. 2013 started on January 17th here in Denver. I have conquered the mouse and I am quite certain that I will now be able to conquer anything that the year has in store. Broke as as joke? Psh, What else is new. Pimples and wrinkles? BRING IT. Stolen bike? These legs are good to walk, skip, and run. I went to bed that night, in a mouse-less house, struck with sudden desires to learn to drive a stick shift, take a self defense class, ask to be compensated for my work, and generally be more spontaneous and kick-butt.  Heck , I thought,  if I can kill the smartest mouse in the history of mice, I can probably take a stab at croissants, tamales, mole, merengue, kombucha, and other seemingly terrifying cooking projects with style.  So\u2026 in the three days since the mouse was evicted I got a nose ring, dropped three grand on airfare to Chile, and made tamales, with kale and apples, which, for the record, are totally not hard and you should try immediately. You will feel like Joan of Arc and go on to make crazy-wonderful and empowered decisions in your day and year.

VDirections\u000a
p2173
aVFirst thing is first, submerge corn husks in a deep bowl with boiling water and allow to soften for 30 minutes to 1 hour. I use a heavy jar of coconut oil to keep the husks from floating. In a large bowl combine masa, baking powder, oregano, and salt. Mix together warm water and melted coconut oil and pour over masa mixture, stirring until a dough forms. Set aside and cover.\u000a
p2174
aVIn a large cast iron or heavy skillet, saute onions and garlic in olive oil until translucent but not browned. Add the ancho and chipotle powders and the juice of the lime. Stir and let simmer. Remove spines of the kale and roughly tear leaves into the onion mixture on the stove. Stir in apples, fresh jalapeno and salt. Cook until the kale is wilted and apples are tender. Remove from heat, mix in cheese to melt.\u000a
p2175
aVFor the assembly of the tamales, create an assembly line of bowls with the masa, husks, and filling. Place one softened husk on the cutting board or counter and fill with dough. I didn\u2019t measure, but I\u2019d estimate I used +/- a 1/2 cup of masa mixture per tamale. Press dough into the face of the husk leaving an inch or so dead space around the perimeter. It doesn\u2019t have to be pretty. Don\u2019t sweat it. Spoon a bit of the cheesy kale mixture into the center of the masa platform you\u2019ve created. I think I used more like 1/3 cup of filling per tamale. None of them are the same size or shape, just go with it. Wrap like you would a book-shaped gift, fold over the right side then the left, overlapping the edges. Flip up the bottom tail and place seam-side down on a plate. Repeat until you have filled 15-20 tamales, depending on how full you stuff them.\u000a
p2176
aVTo steam the tamales I used a large pot with the pasta-colander attachment, although I have read and heard about steaming racks that can be placed in caserole dishes and the like. I imagine you could easily use a pop-out vegetable steamer in a deep pot or even a rice cooker, too. Place all the tamales in the basin of the vessel with the seam sides down. Cook for 45 minutes.\u000a

VI saw your comment come through last week on my lunch break and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about you since. When asked, you  shared that you intend stand in your truth this year by holding fast to the understanding that you don\u2019t need to have your whole life after college completely planned out, that you can just take it step by step. Oh Sarah, I wish I could stand sideline giving high-fives and waving my pom-pom\u2019s about to cheer you on through this phase and in this truth. A year ago I stood in some version of your shoes, looking ahead to the future with confidence and eagerness and a whole lot of  WHOA, WHAT NOW  swirling in my belly. As you begin to close this big chapter of your life, here is what I want you to know\u2026 you\u2019re not alone. This month and every month henceforth there will be women graduating college, giving birth to their first children, changing jobs, moving to different countries, suffering great loss, celebrating small victories, and will be, in sum, simultaneously in the process of discovering the person they are meant to become, the work they are here to do on this planet, and what in the heck it\u2019s all going to look like. The truth is, plan or not, the next year of your life, and life after college at large, will look nothing and everything like you could possibly imagine. I had trouble sleeping the night before we started our trek in Patagonia last month so I got out of bed before dawn and sat on the floor in the powder-blue tiled bathroom of Maria\u2019s Hostel, cutting my nails, counting and reflecting upon the memories and mistakes of the past year. I leaned against the door and stared at the fluorescent light overhead and wondered what God was thinking in that moment. Silence. Taped next to the sink a printed sign \u201c no lave la ropa  \u2013 do not wash the clothes.\u201d I had to laugh. If someone would have told me a year ago that I would be sitting on the floor of a bathroom in Chile in the kind of mental, physical, spiritual state I found myself experiencing, I would have thought they were out of their freaking mind. This is to say, the next year will be more outrageously beautiful and thrilling and fulfilling than you could hope. It will also challenge you to dig in to the deepest, most sacred parts of your soul to stay true to who you are and to fight through all sorts of exhaustion, loneliness, and missed turns. You will meet many teachers. Some of them will come to you carrying the light. They are the universe\u2019s way of telling you that you are powerful and beautiful and full of so much potential. They will hold you up like buoys when you get tired during the big swim. They will usher and encourage you to see and take paths that will help you stretch and grow and develop into the woman you\u2019re meant to become. Some teachers will come into your life throwing big punches, they are, what an old friend used to call \u201cthe darkies.\u201d They will make you wrestle with your idea of right and wrong and good and bad and test you, persistently, to hold on to yourself. You will duck and miss the blows most days but sometimes you\u2019ll forget about the hook shot and you\u2019ll be on your back seeing stars. It\u2019s okay. This is all part of it. The toughest teachers will be the ones that look like they\u2019re carrying the light, but are carrying something else. They will present you with some pretty sweet sounding opportunities and lifestyles. There will be a split-second lightning bolt feeling you\u2019ll get in your chest when you first meet these teachers that sets you at dis-ease. Latch on to that! Remember this feeling. It is your intuition whispering to stay centered, stay true. Dig into those deep reserves of strength and surround yourself with those who love you unconditionally. They\u2019ll remind you to not take the bait. Try new things. Put yourself in environments and situations that push on the tender spots of your heart. Look hard. Listen hard. Watch the way people live and love. Be an observer of everything around you and all that you feel. When you are paying attention, the right paths and the \u201cplan\u201d for which you were put here to charge will be revealed to you. Try to block out the noise of \u201cshoulds\u201d that society or your tribe has prescribed for you. It\u2019s your journey. Write it in YOUR pretty colors. As for a career, you very well may find yourself graduating with a degree in International Politics or Advanced Mathematics and taking a job at a grocery store stuffing tortellini in plastic cups for ten bucks an hour. It\u2019s okay. That phase will be part of your becoming. In those places you will learn the dignity of hard work, the true meaning of community, and expand the breadth of your compassion for all people and all things. You will laugh a lot. There will be days when all it takes for the wind to blow across your face a certain way and you will be moved to tears with gratitude for all that is. You will cry a lot. There will be nights where the questions and the confusion and the unknown will completely swallow you whole. You will make great choices, you will make really shitty choices. They all matter. When you find yourself in situations or relationships or places that in your gut you know to be pulling you away from who you are, find the courage to leave them. When you find yourself in situations or relationships or places that you know in your gut to be right and whole, find the courage to stay. Even if you\u2019re scared to death. Joan Didion says, \u201cwe have to choose the places we don\u2019t walk away from.\u201d Sometimes it will be easier to run than it is to stay. It\u2019s up to you. If you want to see the world, do it. Nothing is stopping you. Go out and hear the bells ring on steps of Spanish Cathedrals, meditate in a Shinto temple, offer flowers and your secrets to the River Ganges, ride a bike in the rain through the farms of central Vietnam. If you feel called to go then go. You must. Remember too, though, that you don\u2019t need to fling yourself across the globe to shift your perspective. A new place doesn\u2019t change your life. You change your life. You will, at every moment of the next year, have the extraordinary gift of choice to redirect your sails. I will not look back on the past year and see our pilgrimage to Patagonia as the catalyst for closing chapters and starting new ones. I will see a girl sitting in the shower, weeks before mountains and rivers and glaciars with no tears left to cry, letting the water rush over her shoulders and taking the responsibility, FINALLY holding herself accountable, and deciding that she wanted things to be different in her life. Once I truly believed myself capable, a million answers to the million questions I had asked for months on end seemed to appear on the tub ledge, mine for the taking and making. Patagonia didn\u2019t give me that. I gave me that. And you can, and will, too. I quit my grocery store gig when I got back from Chile, almost a year after leaving San Diego and playing my first hand. I am grateful for what was, but time that I set intentions in my heart and to the people I love to be a better partner, better friend, and to set free alllll the lessons and teachers and triumphs and setbacks to make space for new ones. My truth, today, is different than it was last year and I know it will be different in six months, a year, and every year for the rest of my life but like you, I know that I can take it all step by step. Today if I meet someone at a coffee shop or the lobby of the DMV and they ask me what I \u201cdo\u201d I will say I am a writer. I have no idea what that means, really, at least in the tangible sense, but I know just saying it out loud will help manifest my truth. I know that when you are brave and you are honoring of yourself and others, the world gets all sneaky and wonderful on you, wrapping you up in it\u2019s arms to celebrate and support you to keep on. Hold on to those moments. Lap them up. Roll around in them and know that YOUR plan, and the kind of earnestness and passion it will take to discover, is perfect. Go get \u2018em Sarah. You\u2019re right, you don\u2019t need your life planned out after college. Stand in your truth and know that I am here, we are ALL here, doing cartwheels for you and the journey ahead.

VToday I\u2019m partnering with  The Giving Table The Lunchbox Fund , and nearly one hundred other food bloggers to feed impoverished and orphaned schoolchildren in South Africa. We\u2019re donating our posts and asking our readers to join us in  raising (at least) $5,000  to provide a daily meal to 100 children for an a whole year. Children with empty tummies at school can\u2019t achieve their full potential. With the collective help of our reader base, we hope to nourish minds, nourish a nation, and positively impact the planet. Nicole Gulotta asked us to share a personal anecdote to plead the case of  this fantastic cause , and while I will eventually get to that, I think it goes without saying that hunger at home and abroad is a problem that should take very little convincing to get behind. It is stunning and despicable to me that nearly 65 percent of all South African children are food insecure and that 1.9 million of those children are orphans as a result of HIV and AIDS. It is also unacceptable to me that 1 in 5 children here in the U.S, the so-called \u201cgreatest country in the world\u201d live in a household that struggles to put food on the table. This would never be true of the \u201cgreatest\u201d country in the world. South Africa lives in a tender corner of my heart. In 2010 I lived on a small ship for five months with a few hundred students, professors, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu sailing across the Atlantic, around the horn of Africa, through the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea, and finally back across the Pacific. On the days we weren\u2019t at port he gave lectures on the history of his country, Apartheid, the meaning of  Ubuntu , and spent his mealtimes fraternizing with young people in the mess hall. On one evening I remember sitting around a round table with  six women and one guy, a phenom to Arch (what we called him affectionately), that merited he scoot from his table to ours. He looked at us, giggled, and proceeded to circle the perimeter, tapping our heads like a game of duck-duck goose until he reached our male friend, Nimish, and squealed \u201cyou lucky little bugger!\u201d before skipping off. He is at once the fieriest and goofiest person I\u2019ve been lucky to experience and my life is forever changed by his unwavering optimism for human goodness, capacity for love and forgiveness, and his belief that young people can change the world. A lot of things get the man riled up, and hunger is one of them. \u201cI doubt if there is a single moment in our history when all human beings have had enough to eat. Even today, in a world where it is possible to communicate across thousands of miles\u2026 close to 1 billion men, women and children will go to bed hungry tonight around the world. Yet a lifetime of experience has taught me that there is no problem so great it cannot be solved, no injustice so deeply entrenched it cannot be overcome. And that includes hunger. Hunger is not a natural phenomenon. It is a man made tragedy. People do not go hungry because there is not enough food to eat. They go hungry because the system which delivers food from the fields to our plates is broken.\u201d I have a  shoddy recording  (watch/listen here)  of the night before we made port in Cape Town that I watch often for reasons private and obvious, in which he says: Don\u2019t let us grind you down. Dream. Go on for goodness sakes, dreaming. Dream, dream. Dream the craziest dreams. They actually often are, God\u2019s dreams. I feel pretty confident that I know only a smidgen of what there is to know about this life and humans and our collective experience, but I know this: we can\u2019t do it alone. Most of you will visit this site for the recipe, and perhaps the half that read this accompanying post will find themselves economically capable of donating to The Lunchbox fund, and that\u2019s okay. We are all doing what we can, with what we have, and the time we get here. But I\u2019m dreaming. I\u2019m going to dream that 5000 Happyolks readers who will see this post over the next week will donate $10 and multiply The Giving Table\u2019s goal by a factor of 10. Yeah. Crazy dreams. Whatcha think?  Let\u2019s do it

VI\u2019m not a coffee snob by any sense of the imagination, but I can appreciate a good cup and the careful attention it took to brew. What I  don\u2019t  appreciate is the attitude that now often comes served on the side with these new trendy caffeine purveyors, and really, the \u201ccraft\u201d food scene, at large. I was in San Francisco two weeks ago with my Mom and dear friend Mari shopping for my wedding dress (found it) (love it) (!!!!) and stopped by a hip and hyped establishment in SoMa for the day\u2019s fuel. At the counter we were greeted with the most appalling you-are-wasting-my-time looks from the baristas for even asking what the meth-lab looking glass beaker contraption was at our left, and what the \u201cminimalist\u201d breakfast menu really entailed  (does the listing \u201cegg\u201d really mean just an egg on a plate, or does that come with toast?) . I usually can tune out the I\u2019m-hot-shit barista vibe at home in CO, but that morning I wanted to reach over and smack the beards off their sassy faces for acting like jerks to my gracious and legitimately curious Mom. Frankly, I could care less about how cool or well-known a person, brand, or product is. Cool bores me. Cool tells me nothing about your heart. Cool tells me nothing about your brain. I\u2019d rather sip lukewarm instant coffee in a dirty, poorly-lit diner outside Reno, Nevada every day of the year then have to stroke an inflated ego to get some pour-over in prime urban real estate. What happened to being friendly WHILE these folks do whatever sustainable, curated, artisan, handmade, small-batch, \u201cauthentic\u201d thing they do?  Hi there! I\u2019m human, you\u2019re human, isn\u2019t it neat that we get to be humans together!?  What happened to being and living those maxims for the sake of it, not because it\u2019s en vogue and gives people/brands this elevated sense of social importance and license to be inconsiderate. On that note, Shaun and I have been on a crusade lately to eliminate the use of the word authentic in our daily dialogue.  I feel like we\u2019re living in this supersaturated season where friends and colleagues can\u2019t express themselves or be in relationship without tossing around the word to qualify to everything they care about: authentic storytelling, authentic branding, authentic relationships, authentic conversations, etc. It\u2019s gotten so bad we have even joked about pitching a film to the Portlandia producers where a couple sits down at dinner and has to use the word authentic in every sentence they speak to the waiter, i.e. \u201cis the tomato in this burger an authentic tomato?\u201d It seems that in the process of trying to authenticate our lives, work, and experiences, we turn our social environments into the very antithesis of the word. By definition, authentic simply means to be genuine. Yet if we\u2019re all trying SO hard to be genuine, is genuine even genuine anymore? It certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it. When a friend emails, \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to authentically relating with you\u201d in regard to an impending meet-up, I scratch my head and think, oh wait, you mean, like JUST BEING ALIVE TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM AND LISTENING TO ONE ANOTHER? I realize that this is a terribly circular debate, one that I know seems to wrap around and over itself and runs into all sorts of dead-ends and fingers pointed right back at me at various times of my life. That said, I think it\u2019s worth stepping stage-left and sorting through the mess of how this word \u201cauthentic\u201d has made us more or less of the thing we want most \u2014 to be ourselves and feel \u201cdifferent,\u201d to feel like we\u2019re all not just cogs in the machine. I\u2019m just doing my thing the way that works for me  attitude is constantly in attempt to be emulated by the creative community but most of the time ends up feeling forced in a  I\u2019m trying way too hard to not care\u2026 but\u2026 really I care a lot about what you think of me and my authentic-ness,  kind of way. And then I sit back and think\u2026 I\u2019m probably just a grouch. What is authentic for me is different for someone else.  Maybe, as it has been suggested to me, some people just authentically are assholes. Maybe the trendy coffee experience is sincerely soul-affirming for some in a way I can\u2019t possibly understand or appreciate. I happen to find conversations with the folks working in cafes with saggy green leather couches, gay-marriage posters, and drip coffee more affable than the former, but hey. At the end of the day, the pandemic use of the word authentic underscores how massively disconnected we are, as individuals, to what it means to be fully ourselves. Fully and/or comfortably. We have to talk about being authentic all the time to convince ourselves that we actually are. And where does that come from? Ultimately that\u2019s what we\u2019re left to assess. Why is everyone trying so hard? WE DON\u2019T NEED TO TRY SO HARD! We just need to BE our own weird selves. That\u2019s authentic. Be weirdly enthusiastic. Be weirdly honest. Stay weirdly interested in the things that make your heart sing. We are all unique little snowflakes. Except when we\u2019re not unique little snowflakes. Let\u2019s try owning that too. I actually really like that I\u2019m not the only one who enjoys camping or has binged on episodes of Mad Men or wants to be Oprah Winfrey\u2019s best friend or puts avocado on toast. Is being alike really so bad? At the end of all this, I feel like I\u2019ve made no progress in wrestling the issue. In fact I\u2019ve hesitated even posting this diatribe after coming across a sticky note in my suitcase while packing for our trip that I quoted from a magazine: \u201cgratitude alters your vibration, moving you from negative energy to positive \u2013 it\u2019s the easiest, quickest, most powerful way to effect change in your own life and the world.\u201d Gulp. In some weird way, sorting through and throwing out the bullshit in our lives is a way of expressing gratitude. What if we were all just too darn grateful to worry about what\u2019s most cool or most authentic? We don\u2019t get enough time in this life to navel-gaze on the these matters, and I\u2019m stomping my feet and throwing my arms to just say so. Be a nice human. Listen well. Be intentional. Speak your truth. Say thank you. Like what you like. Love what you love. Do what you do. That\u2019s all I have left to say about that.

Our story is my favorite secret. After a summer to meditate and celebrate this next season, I think it\u2019s cool we let the internets in on the news. I can\u2019t wait to hold you, weep with you, laugh with you, fight with you, thrive with you, unfold with you every day for the rest of my life. This. This love. This time. I love this crazy, complex bond on our best and worst days. I hope we never stop changing. I hope we never stop growing, shedding, breaking, and billowing into new parts of each other, new parts of ourselves. This love with you has been the best and most challenging thing I\u2019ve ever done; and, after all these years (eight! can you believe it?), there is still nothing I am more proud of. Without you I am a shadow version of myself, and every day by your side, I am learning to be a better human, a better friend, and a better partner. I love you. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. Here\u2019s to conscious commitment. Here\u2019s to the freaking miracle that we\u2019re here, now. Here\u2019s to all the years and lines and thrills we have still to earn and learn. What do you say? Meet me in June next year, by that mountain we love with all of our friends? I\u2019ll wear a white dress, and hand you my whole heart. Hey friends, we\u2019re getting married. When we were in Mexico , I had enchiladas with mole every night. Not joking. I\u2019ve taken Rick Bayless\u2019s recipe from the Mexican State dinner in 2010 and did a bit of tinkering to make you a cliff notes version. I can see you rolling your eyes at me now\u2026 MOLE, KELSEY? A bajillion ingredients, I know, but I promise you it\u2019s worth it and when it\u2019s all said and done you\u2019ll have loads of leftovers and can flex your muscles and proudly say,  \u201cI AM WOMAN!

VStep 1: Soak chiles in boiling water for 30 minutes. In a large dutch oven, melt coconut oil and sauté onion and garlic until they begin to brown and caramelize \u2013 about 20 minutes.\u000a
p2497
aVStep 2: While the onion and garlic are doing their jig, preheat the oven to 350.\u2019 Spread nuts and sesame seeds on a baking sheet with parchment paper. When the oven is to temp, roast the nuts for 12 minutes or until golden. Place nuts and seeds in a blender along with 1 1/2 cups of the broth and blend to as smooth a puree as you can. Transfer to a small bowl.\u000a
p2498
aV Step 3: Without rinsing the blender, combine the canned tomatoes with another 1/2 cup of the broth and puree. Pour into another bowl. Again, without rinsing the blender, combine the roasted onion and garlic with the toasted bread, cloves, black pepper, cinnamon, oregano, thyme, banana and 3/4 cup broth. Blend to a smooth puree and pour into a small bowl. Finally, without rinsing the blender, scoop in half of the chiles, measure in 1/2 cup of the soaking liquid, blend to a smooth puree, then pour into another bowl. Repeat with the remaining chiles and another 1/2 cup of the soaking liquid.\u000a
p2499
aVStep 4: From four purees, you have your mole. In the same dutch oven you used for the onions and garlic, heat 3 tablespoons of coconut oil and set over medium-high heat. When very hot, add the tomato puree and stir and scrape (a flat-sided wooden spatula works well here) for 15 to 20 minutes until reduced, thick as tomato paste, and very dark (it\u2019ll be the color of cinnamon stick and may be sticking to the pot in places). Add the nut puree and continue the stirring and scraping until reduced, thick and dark again, about 8 minutes. Then, as you guessed it, add the banana-spice puree and stir and scrape for another 7 or 8 minutes as the whole thing simmers back down to a thick mass about the same color it was before you added this one. Add the chile puree, stir well and let reduce over medium-low heat until very thick and almost black, about 30 minutes, stirring regularly. Stir in the remaining broth and the chocolate, partially cover and simmer gently for about an hour, for all the flavors to come together. Season with salt and sugar.\u000a
p2500
aVStep 5: In batches in a loosely covered blender, puree the sauce until as smooth as possible. Return the mole to the same pot and heat it to a simmer. For enchiladas, fill 3 small tortillas with chicken or vegetables (if vegetarian preference). Lay on a plate, then drown them in a hefty spoonful of mole, top with sour cream and cilantro leaves.\u000a

You\u2019ve seen me cook from  The Cancer Fighting Kitchen  and  One Bite at a Time  over the years, and I\u2019m just thrilled to share her third nourishing gift to the world. The Longevity Kitchen is packed with healthful, accesible recipes to help readers combat chronic disease and lead healthier, happier lives. It may not get the blogger pony-show like  Vegetable Literacy  (which is amazing, too), but it is of equal importance and measure in our conversations on cherishing the good things growing and how they heal us inside and out. Rebecca wrote \u201cstand in your truth, Kelsey\u201d in the front pages of the copy she sent me while I was away in Chile. It is a prayer that has permeated and punctuated my days lately as I begin to make significant changes in my life. With that\u2026 I\u2019m giving away one copy of  The Longevity Kitchen  to a reader who can tell me how they plan to stand in their truth this week, this month, or this year.

VTo start, prep all of your veggies and working ingredients. Julienne the cucumbers and radish. Thinly slice the avocados and mango. Peel apart salmon, or cut tofu into 1 inch by 2 cm strips if you\u2019re making these vegan. Create an assembly line of the proteins, veggies, and herbs then begin to prep the edamame wasabi spread.\u000a
p2573
aVIn the bowl of a food processer blitz together the edamame, wasabi powder (adjust measurements to match your affinity), lime juice, olive oil, water, and sea salt. Mixture should be just barely chunky, but not a total paste.\u000a
p2574
aVPlace nori sheet on a clean work surface. Spread 1/4 cup of the edamame spread onto the sheet leaving a bit of uncovered nori for grip while wrapping. At the bottom edge of the spread facing you, begin to build your roll, filling it with strips of cucumber, radish, mango, salmon or tofu, avocado, and topping with bits of sprouts, mint, and fresh cilantro. Wrap with your hands from the bottom around the filling until completely sealed. If you use an excessive amount of spread, like me, you won\u2019t need to seal the edge shut with water and your finger. Cut each roll into 8 pieces with a super sharp knife. Repeat.\u000a

VWhen I was in Vegas a few months ago for the Saveur Awards, I got a ride from the airport with a female cab driver with rose tinted aviators and a turquoise manicure. She sang along, shamelessly, to \u201cI\u2019ve Got You, Babe\u201d as we zoomed along the desert highway and looked back just once in her rearview mirror to say \u201choney, if you can tell me who sings this\u2026 ride\u2019s on me.\u201d I drew a blank. She laughed. Really? I was so embarrassed. Sonny and Cher. I thought about that one year we went as Sonny and Cher to our Sadie Hawkins dance in 2005, I burned the  song  to a CD to play in the car and we sang it ourselves in the parking lot near the swimming pool at our High School. The same song was playing yesterday when I stopped for breakfast at a cafe in San Luis Obispo. It was Saturday. Couples in workout gear moseyed in and woke up over coffee and acai bowls.  Oh, California.  A familiar scene and characters that Shaun and I could have lived out had we never left. I carry a Colorado driver\u2019s license now and and am taking in the California coastline alone as a visitor. Campsites were full the two nights prior so I slept in the cab of my borrowed truck parked in a hotel lot away from the lights.  This was a whole new level of vagabonding. I had a hard time falling asleep and my mind began racing with questions of the legality of my makeshift homestead. Squinting with one eye open on my side, I googled \u201cis sleeping in your car legal?\u201d on my phone which led to a series of other searches for murder records in Pismo Beach, the addresses and pictures of registered sex offenders within five miles of where I was parked. I closed my eyes, said a little prayer, and didn\u2019t wake again until 5:54 am. I lunged over the console to the drivers seat and peeled out for the beach. They say we\u2019re young and we don\u2019t know,  we won\u2019t find out until we grow.  Well I don\u2019t know if all that\u2019s true,  You\u2019ve got me and baby I\u2019ve got you.  It\u2019s funny how much has changed since we took turns with those lyrics in our costumes. Shaun and I started our relationship fighting the dogma that we were too young to \u201cget it.\u201d Truth is after all these years I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve \u201cgotten it\u201d any more than I did then. We grow up. Time wears on our idealism, the ego plays its hand, we lose our perspective, we hurt each other intentionally and not. This is the human experience, in relationship, really. We try, we fail, we work, we regroup. I loved us then, I love us more now, despite the ways time has blemished our story.  I\u2019m sitting on a cliff  watching the waves crash on the rocks in Half Moon Bay right now, journaling. A wise friend\u2019s ashes were spread here many years ago\u2026 he was, and I think still probably is, Shaun\u2019s and my fiercest cheerleader. I haven\u2019t cried this hard in years.  We haven\u2019t always done it right, Hayden, but we\u2019re still here. I wish you could see this love, now. I hope you\u2019d be proud.  I drove to my brother\u2019s place in silence later that night with the windows down. The sun was just beginning to retire and there was that sort of glow about the road that made my life feel oddly cinematic. I had gone back through  When Women Were Birds  over the course of the trip, transcribing passages to my journal and hashing them out in the mornings from my sleeping bag. It rested in the passenger seat atop musky beach towels, a half eaten loaf of bread, and a pile of seagull feathers I started collecting in Santa Monica. In the distance I could see a flight of birds moving up the coast along the road, I admired them for a few seconds until I realized they were flying straight toward me. Drifting. Drifting. Drifting. Yet was sudden. A single bird did not follow the the others and slammed into my windshield like a bullseye. I screamed and watched, horrified, in the rearview mirror as it bounced to the ground and other cars passed over her grave. I looked at the book and the feathers in the passenger seat and felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe.  WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN??!!?  I felt like in accidentally killing the bird, I had betrayed every intimacy with Terry Tempest Williams\u2019 words and thoughts on women and birds over the past month. It was hard not to to feel auspicious or look for symbology. Why did the bird stray from her friends? I have so many questions. I should write Ms. Williams a letter. Maybe it\u2019s not time for it all to make sense yet\u2026 They say we\u2019re young and we don\u2019t know,  we won\u2019t find out until we grow.  Well I don\u2019t know if all that\u2019s true,  You\u2019ve got me and baby I\u2019ve got you.  I\u2019m finally home in Denver. It feels right and good, I\u2019m finding out, as I grow.

V\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to make the world better, because I don\u2019t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I\u2019m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave\u2019s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that\u2019s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.\u201d \u2013 Joan Didion

VUsing Zoe\u2019s \u201cdump and stir\u201d method for the dough, first combine liquids, salt, and yeast in the basin of a large bowl. Give it a good whisk until the water is murky. Pour in flour and stir together, add a touch of oil if it feels too dry. Using your hands, form a large ball of dough and set back in the bowl. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours.\u000a

aVMeanwhile, prepare the herb pesto in a food processor or blender simply by tossing all the ingredients together and pulsing until ingredients are liquified. Set near the grill with the burrata and sliced tomatoes for easy assembly.\u000a
p2675
aVHeat your grill on medium-high heat. Dip a towel in olive or other neutral oil and grease the grates. When the thermostat reaches 425\u2032, it\u2019s game time. Punch down dough after rising, divide into two pieces and knead in a bit of flour. Roll out one ball with a pin or press by using your hands. For a thinner crust, gently take dough into hands and, using the backs of your palm and knuckles, tug at the edges until dough thins.\u000a
p2676
aVTransfer dough to a cookie sheet for easy trasport (I learned on the second go). Quickly \u201cfling\u201d dough onto the hot grates and cover for 4-5 minutes, checking frequently to make sure the bottom is barely browning, not burning. Using the same cookie sheet, scoop up half cooked dough and flip. Reduce heat of the grill to low. Dress the pizza with generous amounts of pesto, tomatoes, and torn burrata. Cook for another 5 minutes until edges are browning and the cheese is melty.\u000a

VThere is a freight train of words and unfinished sentences inside me, pressing against my chest. It\u2019s past midnight. I sit in the dark at Shaun\u2019s desk wearing his black coat with the hole on the right arm. My feet are cold and I have to be at work in four hours but I feel like if I don\u2019t write, right now, I will continue to feel paralyzed by the quicksand that has become of my brain. I stopped trying to be perfect a few months ago and in the absence of it\u2019s restraint there is now this hole, a vacuum for new ideas, new people, and new experiences to flood its place. Everyone (myself included) talks about how liberating it is to follow your bliss, let go, be free, and to abandon expectations, but what nobody talks about is how fucking insane it can make you feel in the process. There are moments, like earlier tonight, when I am brushing my teeth or folding laundry when and I have to look down at my hands or touch my sacrum to remind myself that I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still Kelsey. It\u2019s borderline-terrifying when you look in the mirror and can\u2019t recognize the person looking back at you. I\u2019ve done so much thinking over the past few months that I swear to God it\u2019s like I thought myself away from and out of my body. There is a bench outside of my workplace that I spend most of my breaks. You\u2019ll find me there these days watching people pass on their bikes, listening to the howls of the pool table at the bar across the street. It is my designated non-thinking bench. Really, it\u2019s come to this. A place for fifteen minutes of peace from my own existence.  Don\u2019t think. Just sit. Just be. Just breathe here . Of course this non-thinking rule lasts for a whole minute until my phone blinks and reminds me that I have avoided more than a half-dozen phone calls from family and friends whose love and patience I probably don\u2019t deserve right now. I remember the pile of bills and payment warnings from mid-summer blood tests sitting on my desk, a half-emptied suitcase from my last trip home, and the $13.00 library fine that restricts the release of my college diploma. These are all just things. Little things. Little things that mirror my high-speed chase away from all the calm, away from what could actually help me reach a finish line, a resolution, or at least a reset button. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Is it possible that I\u2019m cultivating a mess in my temporal, phsyical world just to match or trump the spiritual warfare that\u2019s going on within? Yes. Probably. Crazy. Who does that? Crazy people. Break out the  DSM-IV , Mom. I met a woman the other day at a party. I was immediately drawn to her energy because she held herself with the kind of ease and confidence that I have so often craved to make constant in my own state of being. You know these kind of women, or, at least, the idea of these kind of women. The kind who wear old jeans and whispy bohemian blouses with their perfectly messy hair. They practice yoga, are genuinely kind to everyone, unflustered by common commotion of human existence, and ready at a moments notice to jump into the ocean completely naked. You know exactly who I\u2019m talking about, right? There are these that come in and out of our lives that we see and know and think,  God, you make it look so easy.  Anyway. This woman. At the party. I listened to her talk and watched her move and realized that I WAS her. All those things I saw that felt so far away in that moment lived inside of me, too. The utter madness and dislocation I feel when I look in the mirror is part of the same woman who laughs until she nearly pees her pants, cries when lady bugs land on her arms, travels fearlessly through foreign lands, gives amazing hugs, believes love will change the world, eats cake for dinner, and sings Julie Andrews ballads at the top of mountains so even the goats can hear just how happy she is to be alive. Anyway, I\u2019m realizing that I don\u2019t crave being her, the woman at the party, I crave being more of myself. I\u2019ve been cooking. A lot, actually, through all of \u201cthis.\u201d I\u2019ve made chocolate chip cookies four times from the same  recipe  and tried, at each go, to melt with that same buttery pot of comfort back into my own skin. I got closer every time, you see. Really. I should probably keep making them. All of this. These words. These midnight ramblings might be (probably are?) best kept locked in a folder on my desktop for a later date. Something I can look back on when I\u2019m wise and gray and think, whoa girl, that was a dark place. But I\u2019m going to release them here. Be free, words. Be free, mess. This is what a mess looks like, if you weren\u2019t sure yet. I imagine you have had, seen, or felt, or dug through your own and had a panic moment somewhere in the process that you were straight up  bat-shit crazy . You\u2019re not. Well maybe you are, but we all are. You\u2019re human. We\u2019ve got this brain, a million sets of choices and paths to take and a thousand different ways to imagine what it will, can, or should all look like. I\u2019ve gotta believe we all go through this, these WHO AM I, WHAT AM I DOING HERE, WHY AM I ALWAYS GETTING IN MY OWN WAY cycles of questioning. I\u2019m standing at the brink of 23 and part of me thinks it would be crazier if I wasn\u2019t experiencing some sort of existential reckoning. Right? Right. I\u2019m in it. Here. Now. Perfectly okay and perfectly not. I will come back to me. I will. I imagine I\u2019ll be grabbing the mail one day and look up to the sky, feel the sun on my face, and see it all so clearly. Until then, I\u2019ll be here, holding fast like an anchor in the storm and facing forward to all that this place has to teach me.

VWe spent Saturday evening in the garage. Shaun turned on the propane heat lamp and Caroline and I watched the boys build a spice shelf for Corbyn and her newlywed digs.  Drinking beer from the can and sitting next to a woman I admire and respect more than she\u2019ll ever know, I felt my pulse physically slow for the first time in months. I\u2019ve missed this. Quiet, thoughtful moments without pressing emails to respond to, where tense decisions and terse dialogue are not on the regular, when the pendulum between fight and flight rests heavy. Sunday continued at the same easy, tender pace. We went for a long run and treated ourselves to waffles and the NYTimes, laundry to Olympics coverage, and an afternoon bike ride to pick up frozen berries to satiate a brief craving for summertime. I love how Denver rewards us with a splattering of perfect days like these in the deep of winter. I swear they always show up at the right time as if to say, STOP! LOOK!  The day is beautiful and you are here and very much alive to take in this moment and remember how to enjoy the miracle that is your life. The fact that the weekend felt so precious is an indicator to me that the cards need shuffling around here. These weekends need to feel more ritual than they do unusual and surprising. I\u2019ve quietly dedicated my time over the past six months to a local project that has called me to stretch, push, break down, pick up, and humble myself before a dizzying array of interpersonal dynamics in ways I do not yet have words to describe. I\u2019m feeling a bit numb right now \u2014 to the success and failure, to what the work gave and what it took away. Regardless, I\u2019m certain the impact of \u201cit all\u201d is positively permanent, and that the excruciating and thrilling days are teaching me something. For now I\u2019m just feeling in the moment, and the moment isn\u2019t good or bad\u2026 the moment just is. \u201cWe think that the point is to pass the test or overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don\u2019t really get solved. They come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again and fall apart again. It\u2019s just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.\u201d \u2015 Pema Chödrön Don\u2019t sell yourself short and try to use fresh fruit for this recipe in the wintertime! Ya\u2019ll know  I love Chile , but berries picked before they\u2019re ripe and shipped by boat from the Southern Hemisphere taste like cardboard. Frozen fruit is dandy in the off-season and I\u2019d encourage you not to poo-poo it. I tend to prefer darker berries with cardamom, but feel free to substitute as you feel inspired.

VLast week was a mess of skipped beats. I don\u2019t know if there was something going on with the moon or if my tightrope is undergoing some growing pains, but man alive. Unanswered voicemail. Empty gas tank. Wrong books. Forgotten homework. Burned oatmeal. Molding oranges. Tardy client meetings. Parking tickets. Toothpaste explosions. I seriously was banging my head against the keys trying to write something wise, eloquent for the Beet Cake. Nothing. When we threw Tex, our new foster in the tub this morning after a long, wet walk through the park I couldn\u2019t help but laugh as I watched a million little hairs fling from his back and cling to the walls and fresh towels. Oh dear. In the next few days I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll spot some white wisps stuck on the mirror and chuckle again at the beautiful absurdity of it all. Pure goodness. Pure madness. Weeks like these keep me humble. They keep me loose. Learning how to ride a bike with a rusty chain is the whole point of being young. You can\u2019t really afford a new one but you make it work. You just keep peddling. Shaun and I have a pretzel shaped magnet on the fridge that reads: \u201cblessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape.\u201d It\u2019s especially appreciated in times like these. I love how we both try to hold each other up to this standard when the circus rolls into town, announced or otherwise. He dragged me out in yoga pants, NorthFace hoodie, top knot, and rubber wellies at 9 pm to hit a bucket of balls on the fairway Saturday night and I tell you what, I\u2019ve never felt more silly and more perfectly human. It was great. Embrace the skipped beats. Life is nothing, boring at best, without them. This weekend we took Sprouted Kitchen\u2019s  mini calzones  for a spin, adding butternut squash, and lemon zest. So, so good. The fact that on my calendar I have \u201cmeetup / Sara (SK)\u201d marked for friday makes me think that I\u2019m on track to one day do lunch with Oprah Winfrey. Sara has been a constant source of inspiration as I\u2019ve built and grown into this space. Her grace and encouragement has meant more than I think she may ever really realize.

Fill with squash-apple mixture, sprinkle with rosemary and lemon zest. Pull one corner to the other side and fiddle and press the edges to seal everything up. We added goat cheese to a few after the fact, and those were quite good. It\u2019s up to you. Brush sealed calzones with olive oil and sprinkle with a bit of coarse salt.

VGreetings from Washington DC! I\u2019ll be here for the better part of January for a presidential politics seminar; dress pants and heavy coats are the name of the game and my food adventures will be limited, unfortunately. A few months ago I asked a few of my favorite food bloggers from around the web to help share their talents in this space during my absence. Each contributor has been so generous and kind with their time and talents, honestly their gifts floor me. Today\u2019s guest post is from  Sarah , of  The Yellow House You can read more about the where the name originated on her  about page , but Sarah describes that her blog is about living well in a way that\u2019s unfussy (sign me up, now) She\u2019s a prolific writer,  sharing stories and recipes in her space with an understated sophistication and ease. She speaks to me. I think she\u2019ll speak to you too, as Sarah provides the kind of room for reflection and consideration that, to me, make a blog meaningful. Plus, anyone who has the gumption to go on a  hike with a ceramic mug of coffee  is a woman I\u2019d like to call friend. Okay, enough of me. Thank you, Sarah, for sharing your talents and wisdom here on Happyolks\u2026. Keep reading\u2026 As I write this, New Year\u2019s Eve approaches. I find myself thinking a lot about gathering friends and family into my home and what it\u2019s all really about. I\u2019ve come to a conclusion: we\u2019re simultaneously too serious and too flippant about entertaining. Our priorities are misplaced. On one hand, there are material goods and preparation to worry about: the menu, the drinks, cleaning the house\u2014-these seem to occupy most of our time and energy. On the other hand, there are the immaterial aspects of a gathering\u2014the camaraderie, the forks clinking on plates, the laughter. These we spend no time preparing for\u2014rather, we expect them to just happen. Usually, of course, they do. But somehow, I really doubt that there\u2019s a direct link between amount of time and money spent preparing menus and wine and the level of laughter at a dinner party. This is not to deride the planned menus and the wine \u2014- I like those very much. It strikes me, though, that some of my best \u201cgatherings\u201d have been impromptu late night affairs, sitting cross-legged on the kitchen floor with cheap beer, the ends of a loaf of bread, and some butter and pesto. The laughter and the camaraderie were there, but the menu planning was notably absent. But I am guilty, perhaps more than most, of focusing over-much on these material aspects of gathering, convinced that my hospitality and love and welcome are best conveyed through abundant food and seamless presentation. The flipside of all this is that we fail to take seriously the simple act of gathering people in, of welcoming them to our home, of the opportunity that entertaining implies. In 2012, I\u2019m going to try and relish the facilitative role of gathering. Less stress over the details, and more emphasis on what a privilege it is to be surrounded by friends. Good things happen when you bring people together for the sole purpose of enjoying each other\u2014whether or not you include all the trimmings.

VToday is one of those days where words seem to fail. Sentences and ideas come together, but nothing feels right. I\u2019m saying something, but I\u2019m not really saying anything. I\u2019m dabbling in themes that seem important, but they aren\u2019t authentic. I\u2019m not feeling provocative, compelling, or wise. More exhaustion, frustration, acceptance, relief. I stop fighting the resistance and set aside the notebook. I rest my head back on the couch we bought second-hand a few weeks ago, laughing to myself when I remember how we almost broke my finger in the doorframe trying to move it into the apartment. Shaun is in the kitchen, I can hear him hammering planks of plywood for shelves in the pantry.  Pickin\u2019 on Coldplay  plays on the desktop computer on the tall table and Sadie is asleep by my feet. The wind and the sun come through the screens and effortlessly toss shadows of the maple tree across the hardwood. Take off your battle fatigues for a second, Kelsey, let go of trying to write something big, inspiring, creative.  This is all I have to offer today: say  I love you  more. That\u2019s it. Pretty simple. Say it more. Say it right now, not later. It\u2019s the only moment that counts. I\u2019m not the first to impress upon it and I won\u2019t be the last. Don\u2019t assume people know how much they mean to you. Make an effort to tell them as much and as often as you can. In an instant, you may wish it were the only thing you ever did in this world, and all the other words that failed will not matter. Who will you say  I love you  to, today? What better way to say  I love you  than with a bowl of soup. It definitely makes the Billboard top-forty. And my take on this  Alice Waters\u2019 treasure , well I have to say (and Shaun agrees), this may be the best Happyolks recipe to date. Sweet red, yellow, and orange peppers are still coming in our local CSA box, but you could always use the more traditional looking organic bell peppers from the store too. Greens are off limits, not sweet enough.

VIn a large saucepan, bring olive oil to medium-high heat. Toss in sliced onions and peppers, sauté for about 10 minutes until softened but not browned, stirring frequently. When softened add garlic and thyme, stirring to coat and cooking for another 4-5 minutes. Pour vegetable broth over the mixture, sprinkle in the rice, add a bit of apple cider vinegar, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool for a few minutes while you prepare the blender. Transfer a few ladles of soupy-pepper mixture to the blender at a time, until all of the soup has been pureed. Serve with a few teaspoons of fresh chives and a warm country levain loaf.\u000a

VI had the pleasure of meeting  Laura  through her blog over the summer and was instantly captivated by her honesty, authenticity, and food philosophy. There is a light about her too, the kind you gravitate to, the light that makes your heart feel full. I\u2019d like to call her a friend in real life, one day. At her blog,  The First Mess , Laura shares seasonal recipes that are accessible, and full of gratitude. When she sent over the writing, recipe, and gorgeous photos for today\u2019s guest post, I had to resist an urge to make a second trip to Whole Foods for the day and pick up some dill for this recipe. This is the kind of thing I could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Thank you, Laura, for sharing your passion and light in this space\u2026 keep reading\u2026 Throughout my adult life, food has been there. I would say it\u2019s been a driving force of empowerment; rather than just simply \u201cthere\u201d. I grew up with a local produce market as the family business. It was my first job as a teenager. We always had giant tomato plants and greens in the garden in the summer and beautiful preserves to brighten the cold months, to remind us of preparation, knowledge, hard work and its virtues. In university I began to examine virtue in depth. Along with it came gluttony, suffering, thirst, the danger of mono-crops, cultures that live and breathe with the land, famine, commodities, freedom and community feeling. In college I learned how to poach an egg, make pie pastry, clean and filet a whole fish, sharpen a knife and how to convert ounces to grams. Working in restaurants tends to develop ones education greatly, regardless of the seeming triviality of any given task. I\u2019ve learned that no one is ever too good to slice a pear or scrub a pot. Your reasons for pursuing the industry? To serve others, to fill their bellies and delight them completely. Repetitive, lower skill set tasks are a bit part of that dining room experience. It\u2019s never about you, not even for a second. If serving others means something to you, and it pays your bills, do it well. I still learn things all the time. When I started assisting with a youth program that focused on empowerment through food education, I realized how unusual my own upbringing was. The constant presence of fresh food, the every-night family dinners, a big garden in the summer and a jammed cellar in the winter, a job, a sense of community at the table, everything. It made me incredibly grateful and hopeful at the same time. I was awe-struck by these kids reaching for all of the built-in facets of my upbringing on their own because they could see and feel the inherent good in all of them independently. You know what else blew me away? This amazing grain salad that I learned how to make when I was there. It\u2019s more of a technique that you develop and work with according to the season as opposed to a prescribed recipe. A handful of dill one time, cilantro for the next batch. Walnuts and chopped fennel or mango and sesame seeds, whatever you like. As you develop your own take, share it with others and enjoy it over time, you will definitely start to feel quite mighty. I promise.

VI should start thinking up some creative responses to the question I\u2019ve been getting lately, \u201cwhat are your plans for the future?\u201d It would be so liberating to ditch the glossy answer and say something unexpected  like \u201cI want to be a good friend,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like to learn to play the guitar.\u201d Although a few years ago I would have had told you exactly what I\u2019d be doing after I graduate, today the plans are looking a lot more fluid. And to be honest, I kinda like it.  I\u2019m a  seeker ; a person who is in a constant state of inquiry and exploration of self and the world around me. My formal education will end soon but the search won\u2019t stop when I have a fancy diploma to hang on the wall. I\u2019ll find something good that may lead to something else that\u2019s good, leaving myself open to new plans, places, and people. Maybe I should tell people my plans are \u201c to keep seeking.\u201d  Everyone is a seeker in his or her own way, I think. We are concerned about understanding people, place, time, experience and will exert at least some degree of effort trying to develop that understanding further. We seek truth, in many different forms \u2013 greater truth, simple truth, and other truths individual to our unique human experience. In the process, we are constantly absorbing ideas, information, and energy to process, accept, reject, or reconsider later. Seeking is both incredibly exciting and exhausting. Throughout the course of our lives, we will find ourselves confident in and frustrated with the vast amounts of input we try so hard to process. I\u2019ll try and get to the point. For most seekers, the more we begin to see of the world and the more information and experiences we collect in the pursuit of truth, the more we realize just how little of a clue we have at all about what \u201cit all\u201d means. If this sounds cryptic, it\u2019s not meant to be.  I guess I\u2019m just trying to elaborate on that catchy chorus of that Michael Franti radio hit \u201c it seems like everywhere I go / the more I see / the less I know.\u201d  We seek to seek. To learn, grow, change habits, try new things. We don\u2019t  shouldn\u2019t seek just to find answers. There are no concrete answers. Unless you\u2019re into math I guess. Insight comes in waves and the sets roll in larger at some points in our lives than others. The \u201canswers\u201d are glimmers, flashes, and wonderings that are arrive then disappear for us to find again later. We\u2019re not supposed to get \u201cit.\u201d And this time I\u2019m being deliberately vague. \u201cIt\u201d is the different thing we each seek from our unique view of the world at a single moment. If there were an instructional manual to seeking, I would say this should be the first order of business to address. You won\u2019t always understand, and that\u2019s okay. Second order of business then is to not be afraid. Don\u2019t be afraid of the things you don\u2019t understand. This is true for all things, be they about the future, health, relationships, culture, religion, etc. It is our animal instinct to resist the things that we aren\u2019t familiar with. Fight that. Fight it with every fiber of your being. I\u2019m not talking about intuition. Keep that flame a\u2019glowin\u2019 but try hard to embrace those things you don\u2019t understand, seek them more, for it is in these areas that we resist that we most likely still need to develop our purpose. Let\u2019s keep seeking.

VWhen I began blogging in 2010 I was completely blown away by the prolific community of food writers and home cooks who shared their stories and their inspiration on the web. Come to think of it, I barely visited blogs let alone food blogs, until giving it all a go myself\u2026 It was one of those \u201cjump before looking how deep the water was first\u201d sort of things. Needless to say, I spent countless hours pouring over gorgeous, articulate web pages, trying to learn as much as I could.  Good Things Grow  (formerly So Good and Tasty) was one of the first to educate me on this crazy, cool world of food blogs. Beautiful photos, authentic writing, and  Jacqui\u2019s  detailed consideration to the process of  creating wholesome, seasonal meals was (and still is) incredibly inspiring. I was thrilled and totally honored when she agreed to guest post this week. In addition to her beautiful blog, Jacqui owns and operates her own creative studio,  Slide Sideways , with her husband Scott. They make some of the coolest  graphics logos  and other goodies on their  etsy shop . Thank you Jacqui for sharing this stunning lemon tart. You\u2019re the best\u2026. Keep Reading\u2026 Connections are made every day. Sometimes they\u2019re large or life changing. Other times they\u2019re as simple as a smile to a passerby on the street or stopping to observe Spring\u2019s first flowers pushing through the cool, heavy earth. These little connections are made everyday whether you stop to take notice or not. One connection that continues to intrigue and inspire me is food. It\u2019s amazing to think that one little seed, when loved and cared for, grows into something that nourishes the body and mind. That those little seeds make a meal that I can then share with friends and family, making even further connections, that soon become memories of those meals and times past. When I take the time to photograph a new recipe I\u2019ve made and post it to share with others, who then take the time to read it, I think about all those connections I\u2019ve made with people I don\u2019t even know and it blows me away. I\u2019ve entered their lives in some small way and it feels good. So when Kelsey asked if I would be a guest on her blog, I couldn\u2019t say yes fast enough. The food, photographs, and writing she shares on Happyolks inspires me and it\u2019s another connection I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve made. This lemon tart is the perfect way to end any meal. The yogurt keeps it light and the lemon is refreshing and bright. It\u2019s on the tart side though, so if you prefer something sweeter you can add a little more sugar to the filling (about 3/4 cup total), although I\u2019m a big fan of tart meets slightly sweet desserts. The rosemary in the crust is very subtle, but adds the perfect earthy touch to make the tart more interesting.

VToday is my little brother\u2019s birthday. He is twenty years old today, twenty years of laughing, learning, growing, and thriving with every curve-ball thrown his way. He\u2019s more than my blood, he\u2019s my lifelong friend. It hasn\u2019t always been easy, in fact sometimes it was downright hard. I was bossy. He was stubborn. We\u2019ve both grown up a lot since the days of our backseat bickering, and our relationship has been in constant evolution to become something I cherish with all my heart. Austin, I love you so much! Your visit this past weekend was a much needed tonic. These are my birthday wishes for you this year: Trust your intuition.  When everything is a mess, get quiet, and just listen. You know what to do.  Take chances on love . Girls are confusing. They have no idea what they want. We\u2019re all trying to figure this thing out. Love \u2018em anyway.  Choose Joy.  Rugby. Trivia Night. Whatever. Life is short, keep doing the things that make you happy.  Take a ginger or turmeric supplement.  Okay, I\u2019m trying to sneak this in here. They help with inflammation. For your back, (cough) rugby.  Spend more time at the ocean.  The cure to everything is salt water. This is coming from someone who spent four months on a boat. Trust me.  Buy a journal.  And use it. Write stuff down, get it out, no erasing. Trust the process.  Invest in an ice cream maker.  Seriously. Your friends will love you.  Screw the system.  You\u2019re more than just a number. Get out there and experiment. Ask for help. Find a mentor. There are people who want to capitalize on your potential.  Pray.  Call it what you want, God, The Universe, Nature, Hayden, Hare Krishna, I don\u2019t  care. They\u2019re waiting. Ready to listen.  Plan an adventure.  Hit the road. explore. Go alone. Pack a Clif Bar.  Don\u2019t stop dreaming the big dreams.  Remember underwater roller-coasters?  Let your mind wander and keep dreaming.  Keep loving.  \u201cIntense love does not measure, it just gives.\u201d You rock at this. Keep loving. Keep giving. August Birthdays call for something light and fresh. Alice recommends that leftovers be toasted the next day.

aVIn a medium bowl or in a stand mixer with the whip attachment, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Whisk in the water, lemon juice, and cream of tartar. Keep whisking until the foam is very soft, holds a slight shape, and has increased 4 to 5 times in volume. Whisk in the final 3/4 cup of sugar. Continue whisking until the mixture forms glossy, soft peaks. The mixture should not be stiff or dry. Sift a fine layer of the dry ingredients over the whites, and fold them in with a rubber spatula, gently and quickly. This is easier with four hands. Call a neighbor! Continue sifting and folding until all the dry ingredients are incorporated.\u000a

aVTo remove the cake from the pan, run a knife around the inside of the pan and around the center tube. Gently push up the bottom, using the knife to help guide the cake out, if necessary. Use a sharp serrated knife into water between cuts to help keep the cake from sticking.\u000a

VMuscle memory. By definition it\u2019s synonymous with motor learning, a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition. The idea is when a movement or thought process is repeated over time, a \u201clong-term muscle memory\u201d is created so that with practice that task can be performed without a conscious effort. It\u2019s a concept that\u2019s been on my mind lately. With the end of another semester upon me, I\u2019ve begun to feel the usual stresses that accompany it. With three and a half years practice, the muscle memory is pretty reliable by now. My mind and body quickly get with the program, summoning my emotion, faculty, and willpower to engage at full speed. In some ways this is great. Things get done. Books get read. Term papers get written. But what trappings have my conditioned mind led me into again? Unnecessary stress? Check. Anxiety? Check. Emotional highs and lows? Check. Silly stuff in the big picture. I think the whole muscle memory concept is amazing when you step back and look at how it works in so many aspects of our lives. On the physiological level, a person can teach her legs, her heart, and her lungs to run, jump, skip, swim \u2014 and with time she can be active without a conscious effort. In the same way I think there is a sort of psychological muscle memory that exists too. We can program our thoughts and responses to variety of situations through repeated practice to a point where these things too can be performed without conscious effort. Over time instead of stopping and thinking, our brains skip thinking and our muscles just \u201cdo,\u201d or react. In some ways, this can be incredibly powerful. We can condition positivity, optimism, and non-judgment to inherently color our intentions and actions. On the flip side, it also means we fall into traps of repeated emotions and behaviors that we\u2019ve been programmed for so long to experience the condition in a certain way. Here\u2019s the awesome part: we can totally reprogram our muscle memory. It takes one conscious second to check yourself and say, \u201cHey, experience X, so we\u2019ve been here before, how has my programmed response been working out? What if we tried this a little differently?\u201d With enough practice (and a bit of patience and self-love) we can rewire our responses to certain experiences and situations to better serve us. There will be slips. We\u2019ll fall back into those old habits and thoughts. It\u2019s okay. We\u2019re human. But in time those yucky, dark spots that we find ourselves falling into in certain situations will be obsolete. I\u2019m practicing, in oh so many ways. Final exam preparations included. It\u2019s working. Start with a piece of Spiced Apple Molasses Cake.

VMay was a bit of a whirlwind. It was a month of late nights, long talks, hellos, goodbyes, surprises, tears, all the good things that make life worth living. Really living, the kind of feel-the-dirt-in-your-hands-as-you\u2019re-planting-the-seeds living. May was the kind of month you look back on and think,  ah what a masterpiece.  Signing 6 before the date seemed like an eternity away at times, and while there have been many changes and stories that I wish I could share with some of you over a cup of coffee or a nice long walk, it all can be summed by this quote: \u201cFor all that has been, thanks. For all that will be, yes.\u201d Ahh, yes. The weather is perfect and I\u2019m looking forward with an open heart to find all that the summer has to teach us this year. The lessons will start with Buddy. The happy folks of  Happyolks  just got a little happier last week with the addition of our new foster pup (licking away above). He\u2019s a total love and it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ve already fallen hard for this Cocker Spaniel/Retriever (?) stray. His eight month-old puppy enthusiasm has already inspired a renewed lightness and energy about our days. A constant cuddler, bone hoarder, and first-class fetcher \u2013 we love sharing our roof and look forward to all the new things he too will share with us during our time together. It\u2019s good to return to  Happyolks,  I know it\u2019s been a while. Cooking and baking never went on a full hiatus, but the sharing did. I\u2019ve been trying to find a good recipe to re-emerge from my break, and this one will do the trick. These biscotti are addicting. Careful. I experimented with two batches of different sugars, and thank goodness I have an internship with obliging staffers to rid the kitchen of the leftovers with. I tried the first time without white chocolate, but I think it adds another dimension so I\u2019d highly recommend it.

VBack in the kitchen again; things are well with my soul. There are no pressing questions that need attending, no decisions that need making. I answer only to the boil, simmer, crackle, melt. From where I prepare vegetables I can see children with kazoos across the yard and I can hear the new neighbors moving furniture upstairs. I wiggle my toes on the linoleum and I can feel a few breadcrumbs leftover from before Christmas. It\u2019s good to be here, good to be home. January has lived up to it\u2019s reputation. Turbulence. Upheaval. Shifting. Stirring. The boozy eve of the new year has long since passed, but it wasn\u2019t until today that it felt like the glass ball actually stopped dropping. I fell in love (or lust?) with a new city on the first, my intuition took a sabbatical around the third and by the thirteenth (until, well, yesterday) I was scrambling on the floor searching for my good sense. New places, new faces, and new ideas shook me in ways that were at once thrilling and dislocating. A strong under-toe of emotion leeched at my ankles. Panic set in. Suddenly I found myself clinging to things in the temporal world to validate and repair the disequilibrium I felt at my center. Who are you? What will you do? And, where are you going?  I held on. I pushed away from the ledge. I wrote. I forgot. I remembered. On the plane home I let it rush in. We (humans) can be so hard ourselves when we get off track. We fight those ugly parts of our being so fervently without stopping to look at the mess and think about it before cleaning it up. I\u2019m generally in the \u201cone foot in front of the other\u201d camp of life wisdom, but sometimes it\u2019s okay not to move at all. Just sit. Kneel. Stand in the kitchen with breadcrumbs on the floor. Just be there. Just swim in it for a little. See what comes up. It may take a day, three, or a whole lunar cycle. It settles. I promise.

VThere is nothing more rewarding than watching the people you love come alive doing the things they\u2019re passionate about in their work and play. Shaun competed in the San Diego International Triathlon last weekend, medaling in his age group with an old-school bike, worn out shoes, and a humble heart. As I clocked his transitions and watched him cross the finish, I was overwhelmed with pride and love for this man, my comrade, my best friend and all of his amazing qualities. One of the things I love most about Shaun is that he says YES to life. Yes to the challenges, yes to the adventures, yes to the broke months, yes to the rich (er, relatively speaking) months, yes to giving his time, his love, and his energy to others indiscriminately and often. The biggest and most admirable \u201cyes\u201d has been in his commitment to making a career out of his strengths and passions. Many have viewed his path as challenging and unlikely; but his perseverance has ultimately led to success and happiness. Shaun inspires me every day as living, breathing proof that anyone can thrive when they break with conventional thinking and embrace their dreams (not anyone else\u2019s), even when they seem risky. I don\u2019t have enough hands to count the number of times I\u2019ve had someone say to me: \u201cSavor every last bit of college before the real world, you\u2019ll never get this back.\u201d These kinds of comments or warnings make me sad because they reflect on the dominant reality that many people are stuck doing things they don\u2019t love, that they have no passion for, and are longing for (the distorted image of) their college experience when life was (seemingly) easy and carefree. I\u2019m going to say YES to real life. Every phase of it. As I enter my last year in college, I couldn\u2019t be happier to take what these years have taught me and put them to the test. That\u2019s the point, isn\u2019t it? With this attitude, we both can reward each other by coming alive and doing the  things we\u2019re passionate about . Thanks for leaving footsteps on the \u201croad less traveled by,\u201d Shaun. I love you to the stars and back. When it comes to vegetables, I\u2019m really passionate about beets. No, but I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s taken some serious restraint to postpone another beet post on Happyolks. I was inspired by  La Domestique \u2019s \u201cBeet Week\u201d to share a recent recipe that is simple, light, and perfectly summer. I might add that this has made the absolute best brown-bag lunch to my internship this week, a tribute of sorts to  Big Girls Small Kitchen  and their upcoming brown-bag lunch feature. Say yes to the beets, people.

VFrom the start, I promised myself that I wasn\u2019t going to make  Happyolks  an extended dissertation on current events, politics, or world affairs. My studies in international affairs keep me on the treadmill circuit of strategy, policy, issues, institutions, outcomes (you get the idea), and this blog is sort of a refuge from the demanding and complex focus of my school days. If you\u2019re a visitor to this site, it\u2019s likely that you are searching for yummy recipes and pretty pictures as a form of escapism too. The hour we spend researching, planning, and preparing a meal can be incredibly meditative and rejuvenating after the over-stimulation of our busy days. Careful mincing, flash searing, and watching the broiler are all tasks that require our full presence and attention. Subsequently, our brain sends out \u201chold the phone\u201d signals to our endlessly swirling thoughts and emotions about the events of the day. Shaun is often bewildered that the first thing I want to do after a twelve hour day on campus is to break out the peeler and knives. He will ask, \u201cdon\u2019t you want to relax for a minute?\u201d Like any woman on a mission I respond, \u201cnope, I just need to chop.\u201d Ahh\u2026 Exhale. I hope you can relate to this feeling, because creating a nourishing meal should never be stressful. I run into a problem with this promise though. No, I don\u2019t want to discuss politics. But when I read things about the international system and food supply that have direct implications for our foreign brothers and sisters that are imposed by health food consumers like you and me, I can\u2019t hold my tongue. Recently in the New York Times there was an  article  published on how quinoa\u2019s global success has created negative consequences on the grain\u2019s indigenous cultivators in Latin America, particularly Bolivia. Quinoa, a plant related to beets and spinach, is a nutritional powerhouse known for its ideal amino acid profile and anti-inflammatory benefits. It\u2019s one of the few plant foods that provide a complete protein making it an ideal grain for vegetarians, athletes, and the rest of us for that matter. The demand for the crop has grown exponentially and at first, the surge raised the incomes of the producers in the hemisphere\u2019s poorest countries. Great right? Well, not really. An increase in demand has destined Incan quinoa harvests to go straight to the global free market for export, not local consumption. The price of local quinoa for Bolivians and other Latin American citizens is now too costly to consume, and malnutrition in these areas is on the rise as locals turn to packaged and processed foods that they can purchase within their tight budgets. The Bolivian government claims to be in the process of legislating domestic policy to increase the affordability of local quinoa, but it\u2019s on us too as health-conscious consumers, to limit our consumption and only purchase products that are produced sustainably and   fair trade certified . If we can\u2019t afford the fair value price of the grain, then we shouldn\u2019t consume it. Tough love, I know. But you vote with your wallet. Food policy around the globe is tragic, truly it is, and Bolivia isn\u2019t the only country that bears the cost of our unprecedented standard of living. Bananas in Nicaragua? Hello. For Latin America and beyond, If we all take small individual steps, we can reverse these exploitative and unbalanced patterns of the world economic system \u2014 and really, they\u2019re easy to take in the kitchen. Idealistic? Sure. But it matters. So, quinoa lovers out there\u2026 here is a recipe that  honors  this beautiful \u201clost Incan\u201d grain and the hard work it took to produce it. Please be a conscious consumer and use fair trade, certified organic products!

VIf you find baby artichokes at your local farmers market or Whole Foods, chop off the ends and about ½ inch off the top and peel away a few of the outside leaves. Cut in half, and toss into a pot with a steaming crate. Steam for 12 minutes until nice and soft. If you don\u2019t have baby artichokes (and unless you live in San Diego, that\u2019s probably the majority of you) break open a can of artichoke hearts and rinse. With your prepared artichoke variety, toss with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and set aside. Turn oven on to a high broil setting.\u000a

aVIn a small pot, prepare the quinoa according to the package instructions. Like rice, it\u2019s a 2:1 ratio, grain to water or vegetable broth. Bring water and grain to a boil, then reduce heat and cover for 12 minutes. Remove from heat when finished.\u000a
p3485
aVMeanwhile, using the same pot that you steamed the chokes in, refill with a bit of water and steam the potatoes until tender. Set aside. In a sauté pan, over medium heat, sauté the shallots and garlic in some olive oil until golden (3-5 minutes). Add the potatoes, cherry tomatoes, olives, and parsley and stir over low heat. Add a little lemon zest and a bit of the olive liquid from the jar if you feel the mixture is too dry. The oven should be ready for the chokes, so send em in for about 5 minutes or until they are lightly browned on the edges. Add chokes and olive oil liquid to the sauté pan, removed from the heat source, and stir. Finally, add the quinoa, a few sprinkles of salt and pepper and garnish with a few sliced almonds.\u000a

V\u201cThe smell of good bread baking, like the sound of lightly flowing water, is indescribable in its evocation of innocence and delight\u2026 [Breadmaking is] one of those almost hypnotic businesses, like a dance from some ancient ceremony. It leaves you filled with one of the world\u2019s sweetest smells\u2026 there is no chiropractic treatment, no Yoga exercise, no hour of meditation in a music-throbbing chapel, that will leave you emptier of bad thoughts than this homely ceremony of making bread.\u201d  \u2014  M.F.K. Fisher The Art of Eating For a girl whose happiness owes a great deal to the likes of yoga, games of rummy over coffee, and a good concert; I find myself starting a lot of these posts peddling the benefits of meditation by cooking and baking. There really is something uniquely therapeutic and recharging about directing our thoughts and energy to the instructions of a recipe. Washing, mincing, shucking, stirring\u2026 suddenly, we\u2019ll have realized we\u2019re breathing again. Ms. Fisher says it beautifully of bread-baking in particular; how the business of measuring, kneading, and letting rest can help us slow down, pay attention, and actually  wait  for good things to unfold. Waiting. What a concept. How often do we really have to wait for anything, anymore? Many have labeled ours the generation of instant gratification; and although Shaun and I would like to think ourselves excluded from the categorization, we do fall into the trenches of haste from time to time. You can\u2019t rush bread. Measuring. Kneading. Resting. Rising. Second rise. Baking. There aren\u2019t any shortcuts or many special tricks, there are just a few simple ingredients, and time. Successful loaves, I realized during the process, are like successful relationships. They can be attributed to attentiveness, patience, and our full presence \u2013 the trifecta of mindfulness. Don\u2019t rush the process, don\u2019t try to force it be something it doesn\u2019t want to be, keep it simple, and savor the hard work. Give it some TLC and you\u2019ll feel so proud that you didn\u2019t take the easy way out (as in, buying it from the supermarket). Start a relationship with bread-making and you\u2019ll start to understand more about your own, I guess. This bread is well worth the wait. Inspired by a variety we\u2019ve always loved from a local vendor at the Farmers Market, it\u2019s sweet, savory, and will disappear right before your eyes. Fresh figs are just starting to arrive at the markets, but dried ones will turn out just as swell.

VDuring times of inordinate stress, pressure, or change, I find that more than any amount of yoga or breathing, the best meditative practice is simply the act of remembering. Remembering is an act of the heart. It gathers the images and energy of the people we associate with the past experience, and we cannot help to feel a pang of gratitude that we were there to share that specific moment in time together. It\u2019s a practice we can do anywhere, anytime. Driving home from work, checking out books from the library, making the bed\u2026 you get the idea. We bring these memories into focus and suddenly the many worries and preoccupations of our day fade to the background. The wisdom of friends, family, and strangers who occupy these memories should remind us that the love and admiration we feel for them is reciprocal \u2013 they love and believe in us just the same. Some of the most powerful memories we can access, especially during times of self-doubt or criticism, are the ones of our younger and enthusiastic selves. As children, we were not buried deep in worry, restraint, or stress. Our full time jobs were to explore a world in its limitless intricacies. We were constantly seeking, questioning, creating, laughing, and enjoying. When I think of myself at three or four years old I see a little girl who was uninhibited, and free. She beamed with light and exuberance, and felt blissfully content to be who she was. The words \u201cyou can\u2019t\u201d were not in her vocabulary yet and she was assured that the entire world was at her fingertips. I remember that girl. She was amazing. I remember her smile, her confidence, and certainty. But then I realize\u2026 hey, that girl is me! That same spirit and lightheartedness still lives inside of me. I can still be free like her; and so can you. We should remember the energy and lightness of our childhood and give ourselves permission to cultivate it in our seemingly constrained lives. Conjuring the memory of such a lightness and warmth can even be enough to push you up the hill on a hard day. Carrot cake is a dessert that brings together the best memories of my both my childhood and of my mother. All twenty-one of my birthdays  (which is actually in December) have been celebrated with an original carrot cake recipe that she has saved from the 80s. When I emailed her asking for the recipe last week I think she was probably expecting me to completely transform it into a fat-free sugar-free relative. But I couldn\u2019t \u2013 memories associated with this keepsake are of an auspicious nature, and I needed to (mostly) maintain its integrity if for no ones sake but my own. A few tweaks to the icing and oils, but otherwise pretty darn accurate. For me, carrot cake celebrates life, love, remembrance, and the many more memories to be made in the future. May it bring you a moment of lightness and tenderness in the way it did for me this weekend.

VToday was cold, windy, and intermittently drizzly. Shaun and I walked around Balboa Park and got a chuckle passing people bundled in knee-length coats, fuzzy scarves, and beanies. Anything under 60 is an excuse to break out the snow gear here in San Diego. Today\u2019s people watching  resuscitated  the little details of  extreme temperatures from my travels abroad that you can\u2019t see in the pictures. Hiking the Great Wall of China in jeans and sneakers at sub-zero temps was cold. So cold. No like, coldest I\u2019ve ever been in my life, cold. I didn\u2019t see anyone wearing UGGs on the Great Wall. In fact, the only people I see wearing UGGs anywhere is Southern California. Hmmm\u2026 something wrong with this picture. 55\u2019 in San Diego is warm enough for a walk without a down comforter, but I\u2019ll concede that it was brisk enough for cooking up something cozy and homey for supper. I\u2019ve had this big \u2018ole spaghetti squash taking up all the space in my fruit bowl since Tuesday, and tonight some inspiration finally came upon me. This is sort of my take on a \u201ccasserole\u2026\u201d a term I sort of hate, because for some reason I always think of tuna and some creepy creamy sauce with peas. This is nothing even close to a traditional casserole, but its layers baked together resemble the classification.

aVFirst things first, give the squash a good whack lengthwise. Scoop out the insides, and rub some olive oil on the flesh. Prepare a cookie sheet by lining it with parchment paper. Flip the squash halves flesh side down hard side up, and send \u2018em to the oven for 45 (+) minutes.\u000a
p3651
aVIn the meantime prepare your spinach, onions, garlic, and basil and set in a bowl to the side. Time wise, this dish takes a bit longer than most, but it\u2019s just because the squash needs time to loosen up. When there is about 10 minutes left on the timer for the squash, heat a large skillet with olive oil and toss in the bowl of spinach, etc. sauté and remove from heat before the spinach turns too dark.\u000a
p3652
aVRemove the spaghetti squash from the oven when the outside gives a bit when you press it with your finger. Switch your oven to broil mode, high. While you let the squash cool for a sec, spoon a hearty layer of sautéed mixture to the bottom of a grotto dish or medium sized ramekin. Next, spoon out one large plum tomato from the can with a generous amount of tomato liquid atop of the spinach mixture. Scoop out the stringy squash with a fork, and allocate between the two dishes filling them to the top.\u000a
p3653
aVNow, here\u2019s the final task: crack one egg over the squash, sprinkle with a little herbamere or salt. Place the dishes back on the cookie sheet and off they go back into the oven.  Timing at this point is tricky; we want to cook the egg but still keep it a bit runny in the middle. Let it cook for about 5 minutes, then check every 30 seconds or so thereafter because the eggs are super volatile under the broiler. Use your intuition.\u000a

VOh, how I love beets. Too much, maybe? Last week I had some cooked up version of this root-y earthy veg   five  days in a row. After I polished off this heavenly masterpiece, I actually decided it was best to cut back\u2026 you know what color it turns your pee, five days\u2026 enough said. But this last tribute to beets was everything I hoped it would be and I think you should give it a whirl. Have I talked about the benefits of beets yet? Here\u2019s a bit of a refresher: Beets are a unique source of phytonutrients called betalains. Betanin and vulgaxanthin are the two best-studied betalains from beets, and both have been shown to provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification support. The detox support provided by betalains includes support of some especially important Phase 2 detox steps involving glutathione. Although you can see these betalain pigments in other foods (like the stems of chard or rhubarb), the concentration of betalains in the peel and flesh of beets gives you an unexpectedly great opportunity for these health benefits. What\u2019s most striking about beets is not the fact that they are rich in antioxidants; what\u2019s striking is the unusual mix of antioxidants that they contain. We\u2019re used to thinking about vegetables as rich in antioxidant carotenoids, and in particular, beta-carotene; among all well-studied carotenoids, none is more commonly occurring in vegetables than beta-carotene. In beets, however, the \u201cclaim-to-fame\u201d antioxidant is not beta-carotene, but two different antioxidant carotenoids, not nearly as concentrated in vegetables as a group. These two carotenoids are lutein and zeaxanthin. beets demonstrate their antioxidant uniqueness by getting their red color primarily from betalain antioxidant pigments (and not primarily from anthocyanins). Coupled with their status as a good source of the antioxidant vitamin C and a very good source of the antioxidant manganese, the unique phytonutrients in beets provide antioxidant support in a different way than other antioxidant-rich vegetables. In recent lab studies on human tumor cells, betanin pigments from beets have been shown to lessen tumor cell growth through a number of mechanisms, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes (specifically, cyclooxygenase enzymes). The tumor cell types tested in these studies include tumor cells from colon, stomach, nerve, lung, breast, prostate and testicular tissue. While lab studies by themselves are not proof of beets\u2019 anti-cancer benefits, the results of these studies are encouraging researchers to look more closely than ever at the value of betanins and other betalains in beets for both prevention and treatment of certain cancer types. Maybe I don\u2019t need a break from beets after all? Hmm\u2026 What I love about this recipe is that it gives you that sweet, salty, herb punch that I happen to crave. Be forewarned that this project can get pretty messy around the kitchen. Don\u2019t even think about wearing anything white, and have a towel on hand to keep beet juices from running around the counter tops off the cutting board. An apron will be useful too, or maybe your yard-work duds. Okay, maybe I\u2019m being a little dramatic.

aV, then roast 1 hour . Carefully unwrap, and when cool, rub off skins with a paper towel and discard. Chop beets into 1/2\u2033 cubes and transfer to a bowl. When there is about 15 minutes left on the timer for the beets, toss carrots and chopped bread with olive oil, garlic, and a little lemon in a bowl, then bake on a cookie sheet with parchment paper until the timer runs out. As soon as you pull the beets out, switch the oven over to broil mode and move the carrots to the top rack. As the beets cool, keep a close eye on the oven to make sure things don\u2019t go up in flames. The carrots should be slightly browned and the croutons crispy. When all the components are done, mix together well in a large bowl with goat cheese and extra leaves of thyme and some s/p to taste. Viola. Soft, buttery beets and carrots, crispy croutons, and creamy goat cheese. Bon Appetite!\u000a

VIn sync with the changes in season, Shaun and I spent this past weekend closing a chapter of our lives by packing up his apartment and moving into the little house down the road that will give him, and us, more room to grow. Moving may sometimes seem like a stressful endeavor, but going through closets, bookshelves, and old boxes helped us to slow down and savor the little mementos of our past that remind how far we\u2019ve come as individuals, and as a couple. Tickets to baseball games, race bibs, old photos from our teens, letters from friends, clippings of the Times that inspired us on Sunday mornings past \u2013 just the little things that made us pause to honor the blessings in our lives. When I was boxing up the kitchen supplies I found an old egg-timer that I had accidentally set too close to the open flame of the stove and had half-melted into the tile counter top. It was clearly non-functional and why I didn\u2019t just toss it back then, who knows. But it made me smile \u2013 this was the kitchen that Happyolks was born, and even though it was so small we could barely share counter space, it provided us with more memories and laughs than I can count. Late Sunday afternoon after some hardcore deep cleaning, spackling, and trips to Goodwill, we stood in the empty space glad for all that has been and excited for all that is still to come. Seventy-five percent of our meals this weekend can be found at your local Whole Foods cold case (Golden Beet and Fennel salad for me, Calzones for him), but I did get around to experimenting with marmalades and preserves as an excuse to test-drive my new mason jars. Yes, I just used \u201ctest drive\u201d and mason jars in the same sentence. First, a  Grapefruit Ginger Thyme Marmalade  and second, a  Strawberry Rhubarb Basil Jam . They\u2019re both sweet, and a little savory. That\u2019s kinda what life feels like right about now around these parts. The marmalade is on the sour side, and I think it pairs well will poultry and mild greens. The jam would be lovely with biscuits or shortcake. If you\u2019re feeling virtuous try a gluten free biscuit recipe at either  Whole Life Nutrition or  Gluten-Free Girl

Let the mixture simmer down to a near liquid then remove from heat, stir in flax, sugar, lemon juice, zest, and grated ginger and return to a low simmer. Stir off and on for 20 minutes to thicken and to prevent sugars from burning at the bottom of the pot. Remove from heat when the mixture has taken on a jelly-like texture and add the basil.

This Saturday precedes the Spring Equinox which makes this weekend an ideal time to come out of winter hibernation and hit the reset button on your body through your yoga practice, exercise routine, work, school, relationships,  and  your diet. I will miss acorn squash, cauliflower, and kale\u2026 but look at all the great friends we get to enjoy in the coming weeks: Apricots, Artichokes, Arugula, Asparagus, Beets, Chard, Cherries, Dandelion greens, Fava Beans, Fennel, Fiddleheads, Garlic Scapes, Grapefruit, Green Onions, Greens, Kiwis, Leeks, Lemons, Lettuce, Mint, Morels, Nettles, Parsley, Pea Greens, Radishes, Rhubarb, Spinach, Strawberries, Turnips, Watercress. Doesn\u2019t that list just make you feel lighter, happier, sunnier? Spring is the ideal time to increase amounts of fresh enzyme-rich vegetables and herbs in the diet that bring renewed strength and vitality to the body. Stagnant energies from winter are ready to melt away and push us forward into a season of fresh ideas, behaviors or  journeys. Let\u2019s take advantage of all these amazing foods as tonics for our tired cognitive, digestive, AND immune systems! This recipe capitalizes on Asparagus, one of everyone\u2019s favorite springtime veggies. I plucked the idea for Roasted Asparagus Soup straight from one of my all time favorite cookbooks  . I love how Rebecca combines the science of healing foods with genuine compassion and grace for nourishing the whole person. Her recipes capture the essence of nutrition by focusing on down-to-earth ingredients and methods that produce no-fail, satisfying, and tasty results. Whether or not you or your family is affected by cancer, these recipes help create the inhospitable environment for cell mutation and cancer growth that all can and will benefit from.

aVWash the asparagus, snap off the tough ends of the stalk and line up in a single layer on a large sheet pan. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and salt. Roast for about 10 minutes. Heat remaining olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onions, leeks, and salt. Sauté for 3-5 minutes, then add potatoes, onions, and garlic. Sauté for another 3 minutes, and as the contents start to stick to the bottom of the pan, add one cup of stock and reduce the liquid by half. Add the rest of the stock and simmer for 5-10 minutes. In batches, puree the soup in a blender, adding the liquid first, and then the roasted asparagus stalks. Blend until smooth. (The instructions now explain to strain the soup through a chinois or fine-mesh strainer, but I didn\u2019t have either one and still enjoyed a more \u201cpulpy\u201d version of the soup).

VLife has a funny way of bringing things into our lives that tote a particular message just when we need it most. Last week I was sitting in a waiting room after a particularly tumultuous morning and picked up an old issue of  O Magazine  and opened it at a random page where \u201cThe Journey,\u201d a poem by Mary Oliver was highlighted: One day you finally knew / what you had to do, and began, / though the voices around you / kept shouting their bad advice / though the whole house / began to tremble / and you felt the old tug / at your ankles. / \u201cMend my life!\u201d / each voice cried. / But you didn\u2019t stop. / You knew what you had to do, / though the wind pried / with its stiff fingers / at the very foundations, / though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough,  / and a wild night, / and the road full of fallen branches and stones. / But little by little, / as you left their voices behind, / the stars began to burn / through the sheets of clouds, / and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own, / that kept you company / as you strode deeper and deeper / into the world, / determined to do the only thing you could do / determined to save the only life you could save. I could have melted right out of my seat. Mary\u2019s wise words snuck into my day and gave me the boost of energy and confidence I desperately needed to stay the course. The gift was unexpected, as they often are. Rarely do signs appear with big flashing lights to guide or comfort us in difficult times. Inspiration surrounds us at every moment, gently whispering and nudging us in the right direction \u2013 half the time, we\u2019re just too busy or distracted to even notice. Direction and guidance lie tucked in the innuendo; the passing smile of a stranger, old songs on the radio\u2026 little reminders that we are not alone and that it\u2019s all okay. It is our work to practice mindfulness and give ourselves permission to spend time just noticing. When we stop to simply notice, our busy and anxious minds are forced to the sideline and our intuitions get a chance to shine. The little signs around us end up only pointing to what we already instinctively knew. Spring is the perfect season to practice the art of noticing all the beauty and wisdom the world has to offer us. The winds are shifting, the flowers are blooming, and the markets are bursting with fresh and invigorating vegetables that help keep a lightness about our days. The delicate bounties in our CSA box inspired a spring Panzanella based on Erin\u2019s at  Fresh365 , but with produce this good my version ended up more like a big salad with extra croutons. The ingredient list may feel long, but hang with me.

VAlthough we would like to believe that many of our better qualities have been independently developed through time, growth, and experience; I think that our parent\u2019s unconscious role-modeling profoundly influences (for better or worse) how we decide to live out our own lives. From the day we enter the world we are watching, observing, and absorbing information from our surroundings and constructing our own sense of self and character. The in-between moments, the day-to-day transactions and behaviors of our closest human contacts, our parents, were (and for many of us, still are) making a mark on our own disposition and decision making. This can be a scary thought for parents and adult children alike. No, you are not your mother or father. But his and/or her tremendous qualities and frustrating blind-spots have forced a response to change or emulate. The older I get, the more realizations I have about how my behaviors have been shaped by family. In lieu of Sunday\u2019s passed celebration of Dads, here is my public thank you to my own, whose traits I am happy to share. Dad, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve rubbed off on me over the past twenty-one plus years. Your love, encouragement, and support have meant more than words can truly express. Thank you for consistently modeling patience, leadership, and how to ride the waves of change as they come in and out of life. You\u2019ve helped shape me to be a fearless opportunity seeker,  showed me how (and how not) to work with challenging colleagues, and at the end of the day laugh it all off over a game of Liars Dice and an oatmeal rasin cookie. When my handwriting gets wonky I practice the curly-cue technique, and I always lean forward and try to \u201cchi it\u201d while running downhill. And like you, I also receive great satisfaction from fixing things, getting my hands dirty, and being the first one up in the morning. But seriously, Dad. You\u2019ve been a role model through your intentions and actions, but also by just being yourself. Without trying, your fearless and adventurous nature has helped fuel my own fire for travel and exploration in the world. As a child, watching you pack on a dime and jet around Asia, Europe, and South America for work encouraged me to not fear the diversity and grandiosity of the planet, but to take it by the reigns. You planted a seed, without knowing it perhaps, that would later grow into a confidence* that I was meant to travel and explore without fear. Thank you for sharing this quality with me. In every sense of the phrase, it has given me the world.  * \u2026 so, looks like really it was your fault that I trekked Vietnam by myself (wink wink) Happy Father\u2019s Day, Dad. I\u2019m proud to be your girl. My dad loves pea soup. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever been a fan, but then again I\u2019ve only encountered it in shades of grey thanks to my grandma\u2019s copious post-Easter ham bone batches. Time for a remodel. I used a homemade mineral and marrow broth as the base, and added fresh spring peas from the market, a squeeze of lemon, garlic, and a little salt and pepper to make this a bright and nutritious alternative. Don\u2019t hesitate to use quality, grass-fed animal bones in your broth, take note from Rebecca Katz: \u201cBeef bones are filled with collagen and minerals the body uses to build connective tissues, such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus,\u201d making them ideal substances to expedite the natural healing process from a range of abuses from exercise to chemotherapy.  This recipe can be easily made vegetarian, omit the bones, but increase healthy fats with more olive oil when sautéing the peas or adding avocado while blending.

Reduce heat, remove lid, and let simmer for 2-3 hours. The longer the simmer, the more flavor and minerals the broth will develop.

aVIn a small saucepan simmer garlic and olive oil for a minute over medium heat before adding the peas. Stir until just tender and still bright green. Add a Tsp of salt (or Herbamere) and pepper at the last moment. In a blender, combine half of the peas and 3 cups of the hot broth. Blend for 2-3 minutes until pureed. Pour into a large serving bowl straight from the blender, or through a fine mesh sieve to ditch the pulp (I\u2019m a pulp person, but to each her own). Repeat process with the second half of the peas. Add a cup of plain broth to the mixture, then squeeze in the juice of one lemon. Take a taste test. What does it need? More salt? A little red pepper? A quick hit of apple cider vinegar? Use your gut, and serve as you like. Mark Bittman says a few crusty garlic croutons wouldn\u2019t hurt, just sayin\u2019.\u000a

VMy kitchen is a few things, but sophisticated is not one of them. Most of my dishes, pots, pans, and silverware are hand-me-downs from friends and family. I bought my Kitchen Aid stand mixer on craigslist three years ago for $50, and except for a few pieces of glass Tupperware and a purple Le Creuset cast iron pan that were gifts from my Mom, everything else was acquired on the cheap. Wooden spoons, a spatula, and a few good knives go a long way in preparing a wholesome and heartfelt meal. My kitchen is not sophisticated, but it is enough. Everything has a story, and they fill the space with a tender and humble energy that I think makes everything taste better. When I think about it, the basic and eclectic contents of my cupboards model the minimalism and contentment I am seeking, practicing, and striving for in all aspects my life. Accordingly, it was a rare occasion last week that I found myself in need of a specific gadget for a new recipe. I recently learned that I am intolerant to dairy products and (quite oddly) almonds; meaning the almond milk I\u2019ve been drinking for the past five years hasn\u2019t actually been a healthy alternative after all. A fine-mesh sieve (strainer) is required for rice milk, and it\u2019s a lovely (and still humble) addition to my collection that I think will be put to good use for years to come. All you\u2019ll need to make your own dairy-milk alternative is a strainer, a pot, blender, brown rice, and water. Simple, delicious, affordable, and tummy-happy.

VMostly just a quote today. There is a ping-pong match going on upstairs. Lots of thoughts. Ideas. Beginnings and endings always get me riled up. Maybe it\u2019s all the coffee. I would recommend holding off on calling me anytime in the next ten days. I\u2019ll probably bulldoze the conversation with things like how corporations should not be considered \u2018persons\u2019 with constitutional rights equal to real people, failed institutions in Guatemala, the movie  50/50 , or how I almost ran out of gas again. I can\u2019t always keep the crazy in check. And maybe that\u2019s okay. I love this quote in all its affirmation. Get crazy. Get reckless. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you to make the world better, because I don\u2019t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I\u2019m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave\u2019s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that\u2019s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.\u201d  J.

VJerusalem Artichokes, Sunchokes to some, are stubborn buggers to clean. If Nigel Slater hadn\u2019t warned me otherwise, I would have been tempted to just be done with the caked on mud and peel the darn things. I\u2019m glad I was patient \u2014 Cooking the \u2018chokes with their skins helps preserve their crispness and earthiness. Just make sure you spend a good ten minutes scrubbing the tubers or else dinner is likely to be on the gritty side. I washed them, sliced them thin, then rinsed them again to dislodge the soil from the deep notches.\u000a
p4195
aVOnce you\u2019ve sliced them thin, throw them in a steaming basket for about 5-10 minutes just to loosen up the fiber. While you wait, bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. In a large sauce pan or dutch oven, bring a bit of olive oil and butter to a sizzle. Transfer steamed \u2018chokes and sauté for about 10 minutes to absorb the fat and slightly brown. Kill the heat. By now the pasta water should be boiling. Cook per packaging instructions until just past al dente. Remove. Strain. Rinse. Let dry. Then toss with the \u2018chokes.\u000a
p4196
aVI LOVE parsley, so I used a whole head of leaves, chopped roughly. But a heaping cup or so would do. Toss into the pot of \u2018chokes and pasta. Add juice of 2 or three lemons, a good shake of salt and pepper, and a few lugs of olive oil. Toss together to coat. For the omnivore, Slater suggets adding chopped bacon or seared bay scallops. Find another great recipe using \u2018chokes \u000a

VI love this season. It\u2019s cold. There are lights. There is hand holding. There is fellowship among strangers. Joy elevates the mundane, and cultivates memories to satiate and linger through the early months of another year, a new year. The blankets come down from the closet, there is ample excuse to bake, and we somehow find time, make time to connect. For no particular reason, there are some days when I am shaken by the absurdity of my blessings. I learned at a young age that the holidays are not all gingerbread and champagne for everyone. I remember that when everyone seemed to be getting out of school and taking time off, my mom\u2019s private practice was just ramping up. While the \u201cother moms\u201d were planning progressive dinners, she was helping the mourning, lonely, and lost to navigate the hardest part of their year. There can be just as much sadness as there is joy associated with this season. I try to remember this everyday. While I indulge in the sweet embrace of loved ones next week, I know that someone, somewhere, is alone. Someone, somewhere, is piecing together a semblance of celebration after deep, confusing loss. It\u2019s startling, to witness your own luck. How mind-blowing it is to have so much, again, another year. Of course there are moments throughout the season that frustrate. Our relatives can make us crazy. You\u2019ll bump into that person from high school you really would have rather avoided. You\u2019ll feel obligated to attend certain neighborhood functions. Your partner will exceed the 50lb baggage limit. You\u2019ll be late to work. Someone will forget to change the roll in the guest room. There will be thousands of crazy, maddening moments and interactions this season. Remember that someone, just like you, somewhere on this planet doesn\u2019t get those crazy, maddening moments. They have no one to burn the biscuits for. They are trying to understand the meaning of tradition when there is now an empty seat at the table. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026 I want every single crazy moment that comes with this time of year. I know that one year, if I am not so lucky as I am now, that I will cling to the taste and the touch and the sounds of all these moments and how they made my life so rich and full. I want to do the things I don\u2019t want to really do, I want to see the people I don\u2019t really want to see, I want show, express, and appreciate every bit of it.

VRoasting and shucking chestnuts is more fun with a partner, so grab a partner and tell them to set the oven to 425.\u2019 As the oven preheats, begin working with the chestnuts by cutting a large x on the rounded side of each shell. Place flat side down on a pan. I cover mine with parchment because it\u2019s a bit \u201cseasoned\u201d if you know what I mean. Pour a cup of water over the cross-hatched chestnuts and roast for about 22-25 minutes.\u000a
p4232
aVRemove from the oven, the skins should have peel back a bit by now. Let cool for about 10 minutes before getting started on the peeling process. You\u2019ll need to discard the tough, dark brown shell as well as the thin brown skin that coats the actual soft nut. From all my research, each nut has a different story. Some shells and skins are a nuisance while others come off quite easily. It\u2019s a tedious job, but definitely worth it. Toss naked chestnuts into small pot and cover with 1 1/2 \u2013 2 cups of water, depending on how many nuts you ended up yielding. I usually come out with a few nasty moldy dudes and some that crumble apart when I\u2019m trying to peel, so my best guess is that I have about 8-10 ounces of actual nut when it\u2019s all said and done. Add sugar and vanilla. Bring to a boil and stir, allowing to simmer for about 15 minutes.\u000a
p4233
aVRemove from heat. Let sit in the pot for a bit before transferring to a food processer with the blade attachment. Process for about 5 minutes, adding a tiny bit of water or warm milk to the mixture to help things along. Transfer to a jar or serve immediately with crepes, toast, or apple slices.\u000a

VI love rituals. When the week gets crazy, I can count on a few constants to keep my feet on the ground: exercise, packing a lunch, a phone call home, a big hug from Shaun when I walk in the door. Sunday rituals are the most important. For me, rituals are more than routine or repeated habits, they can be activities that help define our values and reestablish a connection to self, loved ones, and the planet at large. When we  started  fostering rescue dogs back in June, we began dedicating Sunday mornings to a long walk from our house down to the harbor. It helped socialize the dogs, but looking back I think it helped  us  more than our animal friends. On the way I\u2019d pick up a coffee, Shaun would get apple juice and a croissant (or two) at the local café near our house. By the time we reached the water, my coffee was the perfect temperature and the dogs were ready for a rest. We\u2019d sit on the benches in the shade and watch the banana barges from Central America unload shipping crates onto naked big-rig trailers on the dock. Shaun let me express my abhorrence for the free-trade agreements and cheap labor that brought the bananas here in the first place, but we both knew I needed the barges to be faithful on Sundays. Walking to see them was an oddly cathartic process. There was no past, no future. Just the dogs, the coffee, and the bananas. It\u2019s been almost a month since we\u2019ve had a quiet Sunday morning to walk to the harbor and I\u2019ve found myself searching for something constant that can replace or substitute for those few certain, perfect, hours. Time slips like sand through my fingers, as of late. This weekend we traveled north to visit my parents where Shaun filmed a bit for my mom\u2019s nonprofit,  Wellness Within . Chilly walks, Jon Stewart re-runs, thoughtful conversation, and waking up in my old bedroom to the sound of rain falling on the skylight was ritual enough to keep me in step for a while. After a day in transit, no one really wants to work that hard in the kitchen. These simple, luscious toasts are the \u201cwelcome back\u201d we needed today. As much as I love kale, it really can\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d like these can. (wink).

VHappy Earth Day, everyone (April 22)! Shaun and I will be spending the afternoon volunteering at the Balboa Park Earth Fair with  Plant With Purpose , a non-governmental organization that uses environmental restoration to create sustainable economic development in the third world. Environmental degradation effects everyone, especially the poor. Plant With Purpose believes that restoring the relationship between people and the environment in areas plagued by deforestation and extractive international economic models is key to resolving many of the world\u2019s social, economic, and environmental problems. While Plant With Purpose\u2019s work is exclusively international, I think their mission applies just as importantly here at home. If we can restore the relationship between the protection of the planet and human well-being then maybe reversing issues like global warming will become more of a priority. Some of my colleagues in the environmental politics realm tend to look down upon the \u201clittle things add up to make a difference\u201d hypothesis. While I agree that the gravity of the world\u2019s fundamental environmental conditions cannot be alleviated by recycling or turning off the water when you brush your teeth, I  do  believe that these small behavioral changes can lead to greater and more impactful changes into the future. A person who has never run a day in their life isn\u2019t about sign up for a Marathon on a whim, right? I can feel their scathing looks now. Time is running out! I know! But if it\u2019s all or nothing, I\u2019d rather have some than nothing at all. Because I don\u2019t expect you to sell your car, live without electricity, and forgo showering in the next week\u2026 here is a compiled list of things you can realistically start with today and carry on into the future to show your mother Earth you care every time you cook, eat, and clean up the mess you made after.   Overall reduction to the consumption of disposable goods means less trash in landfills and oceans, and more money for meaningful activities with friends and family. If you\u2019re addicted to almond butter, think of all the glass jars you\u2019d have to store leftovers, flours, and grains. Check with your local health food store if they\u2019ll let you bring them into the store and fill with items from the bulk aisle.  Have fun with it! Here\u2019s my go-to take on the infamous  green smoothie.  Perfect for mornings on the run and after a good workout.  Green, green, green\u2026 just in time for Earth Day. I play around with a variety of protein/spectrum powders. I like MediClear Plus, Nutribiotic, and Amazing Grass. What are your favorites?

aV \u201cTwo classes of chemicals from plastic are of serious concern for human health: bisphenol-A or BPA, and additives used in the synthesis of plastics, which are known as phthalates. BPA is a basic building block of polycarbonate plastics, such as those used for bottled water, food packaging and other items. BPA is a synthetic estrogen and commonly used to strengthen plastic and line food cans.\u201d Scientists have linked it, though not conclusively, to everything from breast cancer to obesity, from attention deficit disorder to genital abnormalities in boys and girls alike.

Conventional food production and distribution requires a tremendous amount of energy\u2014 yet for all the energy we put into our food system, we don\u2019t get very much out. A 2002 study from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated that, using our current system, three calories of energy were needed to create one calorie of edible food.  Studies that include transporting food estimates that it takes an average of seven to ten calories of input energy to produce one calorie of food.

VBetween Kansas and Colorado there is a hand painted sign on a train depot by the side of Highway 70 that reads \u201cHappiness is a Crock of Beans.\u201d  We passed it a few years ago on the pilgrimage from Florida back to California after Shaun\u2019s graduation. It felt so affirming at the time. I scribbled it on the back of a receipt and shoved it in my wallet, saving it. Savoring it. Turns out, if I have learned much about happiness in the three years since that road trip, it has probably been precisely that it\u2019s all just a crock of beans. It\u2019s simple. Unfussy. It lacks elaborate construction or planning. Just a crock of beans. You get where I\u2019m going with the metaphor, right? I have experienced more joy and collected the best memories in the simple presence of a cup of coffee, deck of cards, and a few good friends and family than in the throws of any other world-class adventure \u2013 and believe me, I\u2019ve been spoiled with more than my fair share of them. We move so fast sometimes trying to get from point A to point B in order to become more successful, get more done, and be more \u201chappy\u201d that we forget that all we really need to be content is an old rocker on the back porch with the dog, a glass of wine, and a hand to hold. We all have our crock of beans, right? Those moments, those things that force us to slow down and really feel satiated by the goodness in our lives. They\u2019re always there, waiting for us to see them, to have a good soak in them. As I begin to lay the stones for the next chapter in my life, I try and recall my own \u201ccrock of bean\u201d moments of times past to help guide the little bits of the path that I actually have control over.  Where were you? What were you doing? Who was there?  If I can answer these questions with honesty, I know they will not lead me astray. This is a perfect light dish for this unseasonably warm winter. Crispy raw celery and onions with a peppery kick from the cress reminds of sandals in spring. Do yourself a favor and use dried beans if you can manage. They taste leaps and bounds better plus there\u2019s no risk of BPA from those pesky cans. I used Garbanzo, Great Northern, and Cranberry Beans, but use what you have. Skip black and pinto varieties.

Use a mandoline or a sharp knife to cut the onion. I used nearly the whole onion, but I listed one cup. Adjust to your preference. Rinse and roughly chop the cress, remove and toss the roots and stems. Add the veg. to the bowl of beans.

VJu Ju means energy; the experience of positive and negative forces all around us that charge our lives and shape each unique day on this planet. You know Ju Ju. It\u2019s that thing when you enter a space and get that \u201coff\u201d feeling in your gut telling you it\u2019s time to leave, it\u2019s the woman who smiled at you when you were crossing the street yesterday, the long, warm embrace of your loved ones, the sensation of sand between your toes walking on the shore. It\u2019s the powerful stuff that we pick up on everywhere when we let our intuition take the reigns. We can give it, receive it, create it, share it, leave it behind, pass it on; you can even give Ju Ju a good kneading like homemade yeast bread. We need good Ju Ju. We need bad Ju Ju too though. The polar forces help guide our decisions, steer our relationships, and challenge us to think about life in new, interesting ways. It\u2019s a balancing act; I think the potential for both kinds of ju ju live in us at once and can be used to direct people when we least expect it. Some people call it vibe, at yoga you\u2019ve probably heard it referred to as Prana\u2026 but whatever name you give it, you know that it\u2019s some powerful stuff. Despite the fact that each day I generally rise to the blessings of good health, supportive relationships, and an intentional purpose; my Ju Ju reserves can still get a little low from time to time. Life gets messy, our heads get fuzzy, and the spark within us can grow dim. When I need good Ju Ju, I call my Mom. She shares her wisdom and light and helps re-ignite my own to honor and pass on to others. This week my Mom was flanked with a host of givers. I received more good Ju Ju than I knew how to process all at once. Surprise coverage from  The Kitchn Food52 FoodieCrush Magazine Food In Jars , an interview feature with  Kaileen Elise , and the positive affirmations from readers and friends have been a needed nudge. Thank you. Thank you for sharing your energy with me this week. If I could bottle it, seal it with wax, and send it right back to each of you ten-fold I would. Too often we disregard the profound impact that our simple words, actions, and intentions can have on the world and one another. Don\u2019t. Seriously. We carry each other;  everyday we take turns by sharing our Ju Ju . Give it away and watch it grow.  Chickpea Fritters with Tomato Jam

A bit more on the earthy side then carrots are to carrot cake, the beet variety with the added texture of the seeds and sweetened with brown rice syrup makes a more lasting impression than the former. Add a drizzle of the orange-poppy glaze to make it dessert, or enjoy plain with coffee in the morning. Red beets immediately stain the batter, but once baked you\u2019ll cut into a fabulous rainbow assortment of color and texture.

VOver the past few years I\u2019ve been curating a short (but sadly growing) list of things I\u2019m worried my (someday) kids will never get to see or experience in their lives. Although I am a pretty optimistic person, my heart does sink every now and then when I step back for too long and watch the great world spin before me. I tend to stumble upon these things gently, usually in nature where I am reassured that everything is going to be the way it should. Alas, this has not been the case for my most recent fear. Books. The end of books. The real hold-it-in-your-hand, check-it-out-at-the-library, pass-it-to-a-friend, dog-ear-the-page, make-your-purse-heavy kind of books. The gutting of bookstores large and small across the nation is the beginning of what I fear will soon turn into a world entirely of e-readers and online textbooks. The idea that one day I might be able to say \u201cwhen I was a kid, there used to be stores the size of supermarkets filled with just books\u201d and get a response like, \u201cno way!\u201d is scary. The Borders liquidation sale was a war-zone this past weekend \u2014 books falling off the shelves, on the floor. People were manically digging through stacks of movies and rows of greeting cards as if their lives depended on it. An ugly scene, to say the least. We left empty handed, and when I asked Shaun why we had even checked it out in the first place he responded, \u201cto remember.\u201d Gulp. If you\u2019ve checked out the  recommended reading  page, you\u2019ll know that there is something very spiritual to me about having a house filled with good books. There is a Horace Mann quote that embraces my sentiments perfectly, \u201ca house without books is like a room without windows.\u201d It\u2019s so true. They help develop our perspectives of the world, bringing us closer together without ever taking step out the front door. Even if that stack on your nightstand has gone untouched in the past six months, they still serve as physical reminders of our beliefs, our hopes, and our curiosities. Pick out a good book from your stash and have a brownie. Cherish the pages.

I bought a sketchbook at the end of summer, it was on sale at the art store and at the time I had these great intentions of writing everyday; \u201ccreativity for creativity\u2019s sake.\u201d I was inspired by a recent feature Shaun and I had collaborated on about a new friend, colleague who encouraged \u201cartists need to be creative for the sake of it, not for work, but because it\u2019s who you are.\u201d Agree. So does Julia Cameron, who insists on a practice of writing every day, among other things, to \u201crecover creativity, as it is the natural expression and direction of life.\u201d It\u2019s been three weeks, and that sketchbook is barely filled with the caught inspiration, captured realizations, or daydreams like I envisioned. I love, and fully one hundred and fifty percent believe in the practice of \u201ccreativity for creativity\u2019s sake,\u201d but as Elizabeth Gilbert, writer, says in her \u201909 TED Talk, it can\u2019t always account for \u201cthe utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process, a process which everyone who has ever tried to make something knows doesn\u2019t behave rationally, and sometimes seems downright paranormal.\u201d Case in point, Shaun and I saw Bon Iver this past weekend, and in the middle of a solo set the creative rain comes like a flood and I have nowhere to put it in the dark, musty auditorium. Vernon is singing, I am completely in the present moment, engrossed, emotional, and the ideas come a\u2019knocking. WTF, creativity? I needed you a few days ago. I can\u2019t deal with you right now. We have to be okay with that. Part of being creative for creativity\u2019s sake is  not  documenting it, saving it for later, making it a practice. Let it just be. A thing that comes, at random, irrationally, and reminds you that it\u2019s there and that it  will  come back because it always does . Let the creativity just be there for the sake of it, even if it\u2019s stuck in your head or heart and can\u2019t be rendered \u201cuseful.\u201d Perhaps this is the extended meaning of being creative for the sake of it. Feeling it. Enjoying it. Not having to  go  anywhere with it. Just letting it affirm our sometimes maddening humanness. Fall will come in San Diego. Eventually. It will fake us out for a while. And it may feel inconvenient when it does make an appearance because we\u2019ll be wearing shorts and sandals. But heck. Let it come when it does. The sketchbook will be there, and if it doesn\u2019t get love everyday, there will be times later when I\u2019ll be glad I have all the extra pages. I think. I hope.

aVOkay, now we can start. Whist the tamarind with 3 tbsp of water until it dissolves into a paste. Set aside. Place chopped onion and caraway seeds in a large pan with olive oil and saute on medium heat for 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, water, honey, beans, ground coriander, cumin, chard, and a bit of salt and pepper. Strain the tamarind water through a fine mesh strainer over the pan. Bring to a slight boil, then reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes. If you like a more soup-y stew, add a bit more water. If you prefer a thicker stew, remove the lid to let the steam evaporate. Add salt and pepper to taste.\u000a

VMy parents never arranged a separate kid\u2019s table and a grown-ups table during holiday meals. The youngsters ate what the adults ate and participated in the same rituals of passing the biscuits, hoarding the gravy, and holding each others warm, eager hands in gratitude for another meal, another year in good health and humor. Such a simple act of inclusion, a seat at the table. An act of affirmation, really\u2026  You, yes you, young one, have a unique and important way of looking at the world.   There is so much to be grateful for during the holidays, but a seat at the table has been a gift I\u2019ve probably undervalued until lately. Respect was a reciprocal value in my house growing up \u2013 give respect, receive respect. Our opinions and perspectives were encouraged but more importantly, my parents invited us to the table and then they listened. They had enough respect to sit with us and walk alongside us in our crazy ideas. I know better now, as I\u2019ve aged, that some people never get a seat at the table, no matter how old they are. I get it now. I\u2019ve been on the outside, I\u2019ve seen and felt what it\u2019s like for youth to be dismissed as naïveté. Even now when I don\u2019t get \u201ca seat at the table\u201d (figuratively speaking) I remember this. I give thanks for this. What a gift it is to for people to take us seriously. Thanksgiving has come and gone, but the table is there at every moment of each day to sit, stand, walk beside someone and give them room and respect to speak their truth. Through the rest of the year who will you invite to a seat at the table? Invite them. Just sit there. Really look at them. Hear their story. Reach out to the younger folk in your clan too \u2013 see them, affirm them. They\u2019ll remember. This turned out to be much more festive than I first anticipated while wandering the aisles at the market today. I imagine it would make a great holiday side, but an even better weeknight meal turned sack-lunch. If kale isn\u2019t your idea of a party dish, try spinach instead.

With about 30 minutes left on your dough rise, pre-heat the oven to 450\u2032. Did you know woodfire pizza ovens get up to 800 degrees? Crazy, right? When the oven is ready, roll out (or push out if you\u2019re like me, shamefully without a rolling pin) onto a pizza stone or cookie sheet. Bake in the oven for 5-7 minutes. Remove from oven, and spread a THIN layer of onions first, and follow by piling up on the radicchio (now a bit wilted). Send it back to the oven for another 5 minutes, then hit it with the broiler until the edges begin to brown just slightly.

VShaun hates it when I leave the blinds open when we\u2019re eating dinner.  People are watching , he jokes,  it\u2019s weird . For the most part I don\u2019t mind if people are watching, we\u2019re all watching something, waiting for something interesting to happen. Waiting to feel connected. Looking in, we find relief to see ourselves reflected in the habit and nuance of another. We see something that reminds us that we\u2019re not alone. We\u2019re not crazy. We get to be heroes for a brief moment, anonymously validating that small thing, that big thing, that thing that didn\u2019t make any sense. Real heroism doesn\u2019t involve fancy acrobatics. It\u2019s surviving. We keep going. We keep laughing. We keep working. We\u2019re still here and that is something to look at. Writing is like that. We leave the blinds open a little and share pieces of our humanity, that, hopefully, reaches a reader and holds them, even for a second, and whispers:  you\u2019re not alone.  We write to liberate ideas and experience, we write to discover ourselves. We read to be validated we\u2019re not crazy, we read to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves. There\u2019s like this dance between the two that helps us not turn into a puddle on the floor. It\u2019s amazing that a simple string of words can give us that connection, feed that longing for intimacy. Everyone leaves their blinds open, figuratively speaking. Looking out, looking in, walking down the street, sitting at the stoplight. It\u2019s not just in the writing, it\u2019s everywhere. \u201cIt\u201d being that messenger, that thing that speaks to the core of you and honors exactly where you\u2019re at along the journey. Keep looking. The teachers, the validators, the writing is all right there in the window if you\u2019re looking in.

VI was seventeen, Shaun was closing in on nineteen when we went to the cabin. The idea wasn\u2019t our own, rather a gentle nudge from a friend who knew we needed that trip more than we realized at the time. I\u2019m thankful for his wisdom. Although we had been dating for nearly a year, I don\u2019t think it was until that trip that we really saw each other. Saw each other\u2019s heart; the joy and pain and the fear that lay tucked beneath the surface, the façade we for different reasons clung to. There were swings at the cabin, up the hill from lakeshore. It was barely raining that day, and we sat on the swings and let the wind fill the silence between us. We were both confused. I remember starting to cry, feeling that nudge again coming with the rain.  Shaun turned to me and said \u201cyou\u2019ve got to let me in.\u201d I attempted to start this post with a question,  how many people in your life really see you?  Following it with another,  now how many people do you really see?  I felt stuck \u2014 wanting to make a point about how often we go through the weeks and months surrounded by people believing we see them and know them, when in reality we don\u2019t really at all. But that would be the obvious question. I dropped Shaun off at the airport earlier in the morning and felt a pang of sadness that we will be spending another one of his birthdays apart. The morning was crisp when we hugged goodbye, and the clouds considered a bout of rain. I drove away and thought of the cabin. Five years. It felt like a long time ago. I thought about how far we\u2019ve come as individuals, as a couple. I thought about what today would have been like if we had put off that trip to Alaska and his grandparents cabin. The better question is this, who do you  let  see you? Why do you (we) hold back from allowing people to really see us for who we really are? We must work to be present and truly see others, but we must also work to trust that it\u2019s okay to let others see our own true selves too. It\u2019s scary. I know. But we may be seen when we let ourselves be seen. Maybe not always, but when we do, there will be opportunity and occasion for people who do want to see us, and we will not feel alone.

VCut open your pumpkin and scoop out the seeds and stringy bits. Wrap one half, and store for later. Cut remaining half into slices like you would a cantaloupe. Depending on your variety, you may be able to peel the skin, otherwise carefully remove with a knife and cut skinless pumpkin into 1\u2033 cubes.\u000a
p4852
aVToss pumpkin into a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until just softened, adding more water if necessary. Strain softened pumpkin into a large colander, and again through a fine mesh sieve a few cups at a time, pressing out the liquid with a wooden spoon or spatula. Resturn mashed pumpkin to the dry saucepan and add a pat or two of butter. Return to the stove over low heat for about 5 minutes to just melt the butter and evaporate the remaining water. Transfer to a food processor and blitz until smooth. While blitzing, bring a large pot of water to a boil.\u000a
p4853
aVTurn pureed pumpkin into a large bowl. Add egg(s) and salt and pepper before folding in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time. When you have added enough flour to produce a dough like consistency and forms a ball, turn out the ball onto a floured surface and knead a few times, adding a bit of flour if needed, until the dough no longer sticks to your hands. Take a small section of the dough and roll out into a thin rope. Cut into 1\u2033 sections and make indents on four sides with a wet fork. Repeat with remaining dough. Warning, this makes A LOT. Place half of the finished gnocchi on a floured baking sheet and freeze for up to two hours before placing them together in a freezer bag.\u000a

Meanwhile, bring a saucepan with butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme to medium heat until the butter melts and you\u2019ve coaxed the aroma out of the herbs. Set aside. Repeat boil process with remaining gnocchi. Toss in the butter/oil mixture, and enjoy.\u000a

VThe first few days after we say goodbye to a foster are a little funk. The house feels different. I would even call it melancholy if not for the memory of that one moment where the new family waves goodbye with the dog in their arms, new loving arms. There are few other  smiles more sincere I\u2019ve seen that that moment. It zaps the emptiness in the kitchen immediately. I grind the coffee, I prepare the kettle, and I think of how different, how much richer the new family\u2019s story will be with their new canine friend. People often tell me that they could never foster dogs because they\u2019d want to keep them all. I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s tough. Shaun and I sat in silence for a bit when we drove away from Tex\u2019s new house on Thursday. Wind from the open windows held back tears. We held hands and smiled. For what was, what all will be. My heart was so, so full. Honestly, I felt like it would burst. Words needn\u2019t be spoken. It was a perfect silence. Joy filled the car knowing that everything was just as it should be. Each dog over the past year has given us a chance to practice love, patience, flexibility and prepares us, ultimately, for the inevitablity of goodbyes that the future will always hold. The whole process requires an accountability to truly live in the present. The dogs, just like most other people and things, come into our lives without much warning and we never really know how long they\u2019ll stay. It encouarges us to let go of expectation, give all of our love with all of our hearts, stop holding back, and make everyday a new adventure because you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ll have together. It\u2019s amazing how a little creature that has such limited means of communicating can deliver such a profound lesson on life, on life and time. Here today, gone tomorrow. Fostering teaches how to absorb the waves of change instead of letting them knock us on our toosh. Nothing stays the same for long. Nothing lasts forever. The good stuff, the not so good stuff \u2014 it all comes and goes, as it should. Thanks Tex. You and each of your friends that came before you have loosened us up a bit for the big changes, the big excitements, and the big disappointments we\u2019re destined for in the future. We\u2019re better equipped to handle the waves because of you.

VI didn\u2019t know how much I loved figs until I impulsively bought a pound of them at the farmers market on Sunday. Figs have made friends with a lot of other ingredients since then, but oats and figs bonded more than the rest. This cookie recipe is healthy, delicious, and a perfect mid-day pick me up. They remind me a little of the classic \u201cFig Newton\u201d that we all grew up on, but are considerably more sophisticated and wholesome. I snagged the ingredient list of the original \u201cFig Newton\u201d straight from the Nabisco website: Enriched Flour (Wheat flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron,  Thiamine Mononitrate {Vitamin B1}Riboflavin {Vitamin B2}Folic Acid)Figs  Preserved with Sulfur Dioxide, Corn Syrup, High Fructose Corn Syrup,  Sugar, Soybean Oil, Whey (from Milk) Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed  Oil (Adds a Trivial Amount of Saturated Fat)Salt, Baking Soda, Calcium  Lactate, Malic Acid, Soy Lecithin (Emulsifier)Potassium Sorbate Added to  Preserve Freshness, Artifical Flavor.

VShaun and I took our first stab at integrating some creative media to the cooking process. If you haven\u2019t checked out our short video yet, scroll to the bottom of this post.  This recipe was inspired by the two lovely tomatoes that we\u2019ve had on the kitchen table, ripening to perfection, for the past  few days and some micro-basil that I picked up at the North Park Farmers Market yesterday. I went looking for \u2018regular\u2019 basil, but a friendly representative from Suzie\u2019s Farms encouraged me to try the mini version and I must say, what a treat! I had honestly never tried/seen anything like it before, and I encourage you to be on the look-out! This recipe is honestly so easy. It has all the qualities of a fancy expensive restaurant entree, but is even better when you have the freedom to stuff it with what you really love. Here\u2019s what I used for my stuffing, feel free to get creative though and play with the flavors of the season.

aV1. In a medium sized pot, bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup of cous cous to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer uncovered for 8 minutes. Check frequently that the cous cous is not sticking to the bottom of the pan, stirring when necessary. Remove from heat, add a little water and olive oil, and let sit covered for 4 minutes.\u000a
p5028
aV2. On low heat, begin to saute the onions and garlic in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. After a few minutes add the chard, olives, grated squash, basil and pine nuts if you\u2019re using them. Grind in a little salt and pepper. Stir slowly to coat, do not let the contents start to \u201csizzle.\u201d \u000a
p5029
aV3. Add cous cous to the veggie mixture and stir to coat. Cover and let sit over low heat while you prepare the tomatoes. \u000a
p5030
aV5. To see a demonstration on how to carve out the tomatoes, see video below.\u000a
p5031
aV6. Bring tomatoes and stuffing to the same work surface, and a gently spoon in mix until about 3/4 full. Add a small dollop of the chevre, then add another heaping scoop to fill and cover the top opening. \u000a
p5032
aV7. Sprinkle with fresh basil and a little salt. Bake for 10 minutes at 300\u2032 in the middle rack of your oven. Serve immediately, and enjoy! You did it! Go you!\u000a

VRick Bayless knows salsa. Alice Waters calls him a \u201cbrilliant teacher with an inexhaustible curiosity about authentic Mexican cooking.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. Looking for another way to use up the piles of tomatoes I have around the kitchen, I turned to  In The Green Kitchen (techniques to learn by heart),  where Bayless describes the simple and delicious way to serve up heirlooms and tomatillos. I combined the two, added some mango, and served it on everything from salad, cumin roasted garbanzo beans, and zucchini noodles. Some of you might be thinking, wait \u2013  what\u2019s a tomatillo again?  I did a little digging online and found a great explanation from a site called  Vegetarians in Paradise\u2026  (cute, right?) \u201cTomatillos earn their diminutive name by their petite size that varies from that of a cherry tomato to one of a small tomato. What makes them unique in appearance is their paperlike cellulose husk covering that resembles the shape of a small green lantern that hangs downward from the bushy, annual plant on which it grows. Inside the protective husk is a smooth, plump, firm variety of tomato that is usually picked green. When fully ripened, they are actually yellow, but these are rarely brought to market. The husks turn a greenish brown when the fruit is losing its freshness.With their dense, highly seeded interior, tomatillos burst with a distinctive tart, lemony flavor that makes them the perfect ingredient in Mexican dishes like fresh salsa. The highly nutritional aspects of tomatillos may surprise you. One medium raw tomatillo contains only 11 calories, yet it packs 91 mg. of potassium. That same little fruit contains 4 mg. of vitamin C, 2.4 mg of calcium, 2.38 mg. of folic acid, and 39 IU of vitamin A. Imagine the benefits if you include several in your recipe.\u201d

I\u2019ve been slow to post this dill recipe, but the photos and recipes are piling up and I don\u2019t want to let this one (like many others) slip away. I got the idea for this spread to be used with the salmon sandwiches, but ended up favoring it as a dip for crunchy raw veggies like carrots, red bell peppers, and cucumbers. If you\u2019re looking for something light for an afternoon backyard soiree, this is one is a keeper. I will warn, because there is Greek yogurt involved, the dish would need to be kept chilled!

VWith summer parties just around the corner, we wanted to start experimenting with fun dishes to serve at neighborhood and family get-togethers when we make our way back up north. I came across a blog that was using a lot of prosciutto and it inspired the idea for salmon. Smoked salmon is something I normally only eat at fancy brunches when my family takes some kind of island vacation, but using it in a sandwich is a fun way to avoid turning on the oven. While making these, I made a huge discovery: I hate pea greens. There are only two foods now, that I truly detest: capers, and pea greens. I consider myself to a have pretty diverse and open palate, but both of these ingredients make me want to hurl. I tried putting pea greens inside the sandwich, and I removed mine after one bite. Shaun on the other hand, enjoys them \u2013 so for this recipe, experiment with caution. Instead of using mayo, I made a homemade dip/spread that can be slathered on one side of the bread or for dipping with carrots and bell peppers. I\u2019ll post the recipe for that soon. We had the sandwiches with a side of tossed rainbow microgreens that I got at the Ocean Beach Co-op. I\u2019m not sure if you can find them at Whole Foods, they seem to be a pretty specialty item. Here are the contents of the sandwich, I won\u2019t give you instructions\u2026  you know what to do (smiles).

VWhen I first came across this recipe, I was blown away by just how many spices were said to mingle with the small but mighty lentil. For a split second I challenged,  isn\u2019t less more?  But then realized,  wait who am I kidding?  I try to fit every vegetable known to man in my salads, will add boatloads of seeds to muffin recipes, and if I go through a coffee phase can rarely have just one cup. I continued reading to find that the original creator of this salad was so enamored by the flavor medley that she plans to serve it as a side dish at her own wedding. Okay, sold. The recipe is packed with inflammation fighting spices like turmeric, cardamom, cumin, and cinnamon. Plus lentils are all-stars of the legume family, packing a whopping 15g of fiber and 90% of your daily value for folic acid for every 1 cup, cooked. This salad is perfect for a relaxing lunch outside with good people and good conversation. Pair it with watermelon salad and some homemade bread.

VBegin by boiling the lentils until they are al-dente, about 15-18 minutes. In the meantime you can can prepare the \u201cvinaigrette\u201d mixing the olive oil, vinegar, maple syrup, mustard, and spices in a large bowl that you will eventually combine the lentils and other dry ingredients. Prep the spinach and onion, and measure out the pumpkin seeds and cranberries \u2013 set aside. When the lentils are cooked, transfer to a strainer and rinse again with cold water to stop the cooking process. Once cooled and mostly dry, add the lentils to the bowl of oil and spices and mix to coat. Slowly integrate the spinach, onion, cranberries, and seeds to coat the entire mixture generously but the salad will not be soggy. The dish can be served immediately, or stored in the fridge for a day or two. Personally, I like the salad on the colder side so I recommend letting the mixture marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before enjoying. This is definitely a must try!\u000a

aVI continued reading to find that the original creator of this salad was so enamored by the flavor medley that she plans to serve it as a side dish at her own wedding.

VIf you \u201care what you eat,\u201d then we all should be turning into zucchinis, tomatoes, or peaches\u2026 who hears me? This weekend at the farmers market, I made my way over to a tent that is ALWAYS packed. I\u2019ll admit, I purposely avoided the area during my previous visits because I always felt like I would bother shoppers with my bulky hiking backpack that overflowed of carrot greens. There was a break in the action this Sunday though, and my Mom and I meandered over. One word \u2013 Wow. I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve been missing out on all this time! At least two dozen varieties of homemade pastas, breads, and pestos. Decisions were tough: chickpea fettuccine, spinach angel hair, sun-dried tomato capellini. We settled on the pappardelle with basil on the chefs recommendation. With a brand new hand-crank pasta maker at home, I thought making my own sun-dried tomato basil noodles would be an inspired challenge. I\u2019m not sure how crazy creative this dish is, but I think that\u2019s what I love most about it because when the plate or bowl is empty, you feel like you just got a great hug.

VIn a large bowl combine flour, basil, tomatoes, and salt. Stir together, making a crater in the middle for the eggs. Crack the eggs and yolks into the crater and start to whisk them (as if you were scrambling eggs) slowly incorporating the flour surrounding it until the mixture sticks together and starts to crumble. Add about 1/4 cup of water, and begin to knead by hand on a lightly floured surface. When you have shaped a ball, cut into quarters. Set aside.\u000a
p5336
aVBring a deep saucepan filled with water to a boil. Saucepan sounds weird, but I think this is the easiest way to keep the noodles from sticking. Assemble your pasta machine. Before you start, remind yourself that patience is key in this process. Because the tomatoes and basil give the dough a bit of 3-Dimensionality, it\u2019s not going to look perfect. Accept that. Proceed.\u000a
p5337
aVWith the cran on the lasagna setting, take one quarter of the prepared dough and roll it through to flatten. Fold the dough over itself three times and roll through one more time. Move the crank to the wide noodle setting, and roll the flattened dough through, catching the cut strips with a hand beneath the machine. A little extra flour helps things along. Use it when things feel too sticky. Set strands aside to dry slightly for about 20 minutes.\u000a
p5338
aVIn three batches, place pasta gently in a boiling saucepan and cook for about 5 minutes. Remove with a fork or ladle into a strainer to dry \u2013 do not rinse. Repeat until all the noodles are cooked.\u000a

aVTop with your favorite pasta sauce, olive oil and garlic, parmesan cheese, or whatever strikes your fancy.\u000a
