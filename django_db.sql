I think it all started when my family and I were walking out of a restaurant that offered those candies in the front that look like teensy, misshaped m&m\\u2019s, but that are actually candy coated sunflower seeds, sometimes flavored with black licorice. I eagerly spooned a big pile into my hand, leaned my head back, opened wide, and down my piehole they went. One minute later I was coughing up and choking on seeds, candy coating and the powerful taste of black licorice\\u2026.NOT teeny-tiny m&m\\u2019s.

These days I love all things with the flavor of anise/black licorice\\u2026except the candy. I still cant handle that stuff, but I do love cooking/baking with star anise and well as eating fennel in a variety of ways. My favorite way is still grilling them, which is what we have for you today! Grilled fennel tarts! These little guys are so simple and really delicious.

I used scissors for the ovals and an exacto and ruler for the Happy Holidays.\",\"3. Label all of the bottles.\",\"4. Cut some hemp twine. You can determine the length by wrapping some twine around the tops of the bottles and deciding how many times you want the twine to go around. After you cut the twine, tie knots at the end of each side and snip off the extra length. Then take your cute tinsle pom poms, squirt some hot glue on one, and then press the knot part of the twine into the hot glue. I used a food skewer to do this, but other long pockey things would work too. Repeat this until you have pom poms at both ends of the twine, and on all the twine you\\u2019re going to need.\",\"5. Take out the craft paper bags. I cut the tops off of them for two reasons. First, I didn\\u2019t want the zig zag edge to be visible, and second, I wanted the bag to end at the bottle cap. I cut about an inch to an inch and a half off the bags. Then insert the bottles into the bags and twist the bags around until they fit tight. Fold the corners of the bag at the bottom under.\",\"6. Take your twine, and wrap it around the neck of the bottle while trying to include the folds of the paper. Once you get down to the right amount of twine left over, tie it off.\",\"7. Now you have your Happy Holiday printed bands out. Simply center the words on the front of the bottle and press firmly on the label in the middle. Then follow the label around to the back on the bottle pressing firmly one side at a time.\",\"8. You\\u2019re done!

Today we have uni risotto\\u2026plus I originally had a great story about my trip to Mexico last week and about how I ate really fresh uni, then became super inspired to make a simple uni risotto dish\\u2026.but then Instagram threw me for a loop and I haven\\u2019t been able to get it off my mind, so here it goes: Kids on Instagram should be a major no no.

I was annoyed right then thinking to myself, \\u201cWho does that, seriously? So rude, so stupid.\\u201d Anyway, that took me to clicking on the rude commentator\\u2019s profile to see why he thought he was so great as to be able to leave nasty comments on another person\\u2019s photo.

I really didn\\u2019t have time, but this weekend I\\u2019m making this Cochinita Pibil dish again! It\\u2019s pretty much a Yucatan-Style slow roasted pork dish, marinated in achiote and citrus juices and slow roasted in banana leaves. It\\u2019s such a tasty dish! It\\u2019s actually one of my guy\\u2019s favorite things to eat and he gets it at least twice whenever we\\u2019re in Mexico. Don\\u2019t let the laundry list of ingredients intimidate you! This is a rather easy recipe to make and if you\\u2019re feeling less than enthused about the spice mixture, go ahead and play around with your own flavors (the achiote paste or annatto seeds and citrus juice are a must\\u2026other than that, do you!) You\\u2019re really just letting the meat marinate before throwing it into the oven for hours\\u2026easy!\",\"This particular pibil you see in the photos above is actually wild boar.

When people say \\u201cfood\\u201d people are some of the nicest, most generous people. I totally agree, and here\\u2019s why. I actually met Erik through an old friend\\u2019s brother. I haven\\u2019t spoken to my friend in yrs., just little texts and facebook posts here and there.

Not in a weird/creepy type of way, but more in a \\u201cyou guys could probably pick each other\\u2019s food-centric brains for hours\\u201d type of way. Long story short, I discovered this guy doesn\\u2019t only work in restaurants, but he is also a great wild boar hunter, deep sea fisherman, sea urchin spear fisherman, etc. Whoa. My mind was blown. The most awesome part of Erik\\u2019s passion for obtaining the freshest food available; he\\u2019s a firm believer in using as much of his \\u201ckills\\u201d as possible and leaving little to no waste. It\\u2019s really not a \\u201cjust for sport\\u201d thing for him (which I\\u2019m really not into\\u2026because I think it\\u2019s sad). He respects the animals and that\\u2019s super important! It was really incredible and inspiring to meet Erik (Pursuit of Food is his instagram account\\u2026go check it out!!!) You\\u2019re probably wondering why this weird rant came about, because clearly I went on a tangent. The point of this story was that he had an abundance of freshly hunted wild boar a couple months back and was looking to give it away. I told him I wanted it and the next thing I know I\\u2019m meeting a generous stranger at the restaurant he works at so he could give me pounds upon pounds of wild boar meat. Pretty awesome, if you ask me!\",\"I brought my almost 30 pounds of meat home and started to break it down, ribs and all. The boyfriend and I were pretty much eating wild boar for weeks. (no complaints here) I think if I use wild boar for this dish again I won\\u2019t trim the fat as much as I would regular pork. The meat is much more lean and my results were slightly dry. I\\u2019ve since made it again with pork with nice, moist shredded results. I love turning dishes like this into tacos, but you totally don\\u2019t have to. I\\u2019ve added instructions for my quick pickled red onions and super simple cilantro cr\\u00e8ma. It\\u2019s a great dish to make for a crowd.

The towel you lay the hot discs onto is super important as you\\u2019ll burn you hand pretty bad if you don\\u2019t use it to help you roll the cones.

I get it..you can release the sides of the pan from the cake with ease\\u2026but what about the bottom? You\\u2019re pretty much stuck serving your cheesecake with the bottom of the pan still attached.

NO SPRINGFORM PAN NEEDED. For realz. Once my instructors helped me to see the light, I went home, threw all my springform pans away and set out to buy cake pans in all sizes. Really, all you need is a good quality cake pan, patience and a xanax (j/k on the last one). The cake board method I\\u2019ve explained in the instructions below is perhaps the best way to bake and release a perfect cheesecake. You don\\u2019t have to worry about weird, invisible foil tears that will prevent your cheesecake from rising perfectly, crack-free, nor do you have to worry about serving your cheesecake with a disc of pan still attached! A couple things that are important to this process is patience (the cheesecake really needs to be chilled thoroughly before being inverted to ensure you don\\u2019t have a big mess on your hands) and fearlessness (you really need to be confident in your flipping and tapping to ensure success!) Worse comes to worse, you make a bit of a mess and you\\u2019re still left with delicious cake! One last thing, please don\\u2019t over bake this sucker.

When I first learned there was such a thing as cold soup I thought that idea was really disgusting.

Gazpacho is essentially a smoothie with the addition of tomatoes. That is if you don\\u2019t normally put tomatoes in your smoothies, and if you do that\\u2019s weird and I would then tell you its gazpacho.

They have multiple locations, but it originated in Chicago\\u2026as did The Chicago Mix\\u2026 The combination might sound weird, but it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s really not. It\\u2019s totally awesome. It totally plays on the sweet and salty flavors, with the addition of nutty and cheesy\\u2026SO GOOD! I love going home for the holidays and NOT attempting to stop at a location to pick some up. I stick to ordering mine online every year\\u2026why? Because lines for Garrett Popcorn Shops are usually at least a block long. No joke. Holidays are the worst too. When I don\\u2019t feel like spending $25 on shipping for popcorn I usually go out and buy my own cheddar popcorn, make my own caramel corn and mix \\u2018em up. Caramel corn is a lot easier to make than most might think. So try this recipe out because it\\u2019s easy, fun, tasty, and you can package it in cute jars and give them out as gifts.

When I first saw them I was skeptical, thinking that I would be biting into a mouthful of greasy, bready batter. Nope, not at all! They were light, crisp and filled with chopped conch (think humungous clam of sorts, in more of a \\u201csnaily\\u201d type shell). I think I had a fritter with every meal while I was there, super good!\",\"Anyway, I made my own little version of these conch fritters, using shrimp because it\\u2019s a lot more common and well, I love shrimp :) These fritters really are light and crisp on the outside and rich and savory on the inside. We\\u2019ve paired them with our \",\", which we\\u2019ve used before for our hush puppies\\u2026the super simple, sweet and spicy sauce goes really well with these bites.

Today we have some little Italian cookies for you, called Baci Di Dama, literally translating to \\u201cLady Kisses\\u201d. People all them this because they tend to look like dainty little pairs of lips, cute right? They also kind of resemble two people kissing, the way they\\u2019re all sandwiched together\\u2026again, precious. These cookies might originate from the Piemonte region of Italy, but you can really find them all over the country. I had these little cookies specifically when I was in Florence, although they were filled with a hazelnut flavored chocolate and made using almond meal/flour. Since sweet chestnuts are so common in Florence, and my only memory of these cookies are from that city, I decided to make these little cookies with a 50/50 blend of all purpose flour and chestnut flour. The chestnut flour works great in this recipe and totally imparts a lovely and slightly unique [chest]nuttiness to the cookies. Can\\u2019t find chestnut flour or don\\u2019t want to order it online? Not a problem, 100% all purpose works just fine, although you\\u2019ll lose the chestnut flavor and the texture of the cookies will be slightly more \\u201cbiscuit\\u201d like. These are great with coffee and tea, but my favorite is serving them as apart of a mix dessert platter with tall glasses of champagne. Yum! These little cookies are tasty, super cute and really easy to make\\u2026so do it! ) Enjoy! xx, Jenny\"]'),(265,'Cinnamon Toast Crunch Coffee Cake Bites','[\"Nor did we do, super healthy, super low in sugar, organic granola, or even steamy hot oatmeal with a sprinkle of brown sugar, diced apples, etc.\",\"Something we did always seem to have around for a quick and easy \\u201cbreakfast\\u201d was super sugary Cinnamon Toast Crunch\\u2026.and Corn Pops and Rice Krispies and Cap\\u2019n Crunch \\u2026but Cinnamon Toast Crunch was by far my absolute favorite!\",\"I always felt like I was eating a cinnamon roll when eating a bowl of this cereal\\u2026.and whenever I\\u2019d get to the bottom of the bowl, I was always more than happy to suck down the remaining cinnamon-sugar milk.\"]',60,'{\"sodium\":1533.28,\"sugars\":20.703205000000004,\"calories\":1299.068,\"dietary_fiber\":37.470650000000006,\"total_fat\":39.14158499999999,\"cholesterol\":140.75,\"saturated_fat\":8.836319999999999,\"calories_from_fat\":352.27426499999996,\"protein\":64.643085,\"total_carbohydrate\":186.301135}','http://spoonforkbacon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cinnamon-toast-crunch-coffee-cake-bites.jpg','http://www.spoonforkbacon.com/2012/08/cinnamon-toast-crunch-coffee-cake-bites/','{\"vanilla extract\":[\"teaspoon\",2.5],\"greek yogurt\":[\"cup\",0.5],\"sugar\":[\"cup\",2.5],\"baking soda\":[\"teaspoon\",0.5],\"salt\":[\"teaspoon\",0.5],\"walnut\":[\"cup\",0.25],\"vanilla\":[\"\",0.0],\"all purpose flour\":[\"cup\",1.5],\"cinnamon\":[\"\",1.5],\"sour cream\":[\"cup\",0.5],\"egg\":[\"\",2.0],\"milk\":[\"tablespoon\",3.0],\"unsalted butter\":[\"tablespoon\",4.5]}','[\"cereal streusel:\",\"1/2 cup finely crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal\",\"1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts\",\"4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter\",\"cinnamon coffee cake:\",\"1 1/2 cups all purpose flour\",\"1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon\",\"1/2 teaspoon baking soda\",\"1/2 teaspoon salt\",\"1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\",\"1 cup granulated sugar\",\"2 eggs, room temperature\",\"1/2 cup sour cream\",\"1/2 cup Greek yogurt\",\"1 teaspoon vanilla extract\",\"vanilla glaze:\",\"1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted\",\"3 tablespoons milk\",\"1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\"]','[\"1.

Did anyone else go? and did anyone else have the best time listening to the ever articulate and brilliant Tony Bourdain and totally awesome and badass Chef Choi?! I loved it! It\\u2019s always so refreshing to see and hear two people you look up to so much, pretty much just shooting the shit for 2 hours on stage. Even the audience q&a (which normally I HATE bc man, people can ask some really mundane and self-involved questions and it really sucks sometimes) was really fun and interesting\\u2026some people asked really great questions! It was also no matter that I was on a shoot earlier that day that ended up over 50 miles away from the theater! Luckily, the boyfriend was meeting me at the theater bc of the time, bc he probably would\\u2019ve had a heart attack in the car with me. I may have been dangerously weaving through cars and I may have been blazing down the freeway much faster than I should be going\\u2026.but absolutely nothing was going to keep me from attending an event with my boyfriend\\u2026. to watch my other two boyfriends, Tony and Roy, speak. :)\",\"Some of you may know this, some of you may not, but Roy Choi is my current favorite chef. Yes, I\\u2019m a little bias because part of my love, for both him (and David Chang for that matter) does stem from the fact that he is an outstanding and creative Korean-American chef, but more so because of the way Chef Choi looks at food and different places he finds his day to day inspiration. I love that he once wrote in an interview how he had an epiphany about how his whole culinary career is based off his obsession with milkshakes! \",\" (quote source from firstwefeast.com) How awesome is that?!?!\",\"In the recent (well for the last year) Chef Choi has gone vegetarian in a sense (still eats meat in dishes offered to him, presented to him, but hasn\\u2019t ordered a meat dish in about a year) and when it first came out he was highly criticized for turning him back on something that made him oober successful \\u201ckogi\\u201d, which translates to \\u201cmeat\\u201d. You know what I say to the nay sayers? Get off his back! (see my creepy obsession starting to build?) He\\u2019s not turning his back on meat or his successful food trucks as well as his booming restaurants; he\\u2019s simply made a personal decision for himself and i\\u2019m excited. Why? In my mind, a true chef isn\\u2019t measured by the best savory, rich meat dish he/she can make (bc lets be serious, if we all used bacon fat, duck fat, etc in our cooking, everyone\\u2019s food would taste amazing), but by the best salad/side dish they can make. No joke. I think it\\u2019s much more difficult to push a salad than it is to push roasted bone marrow with buttery toast points or a pappardelle and short rib ragu.\",\"So in honor of Chef Choi and his new found love of veggies we have not a salad for you today, lol, but simple and delicious blistered shishito peppers. I love these things and I love them blistered. I\\u2019ve started to see them as small appetizers around a few LA restaurants and that\\u2019s exciting. Shishito peppers are a sweeter variety of Japanese peppers with a neat \\u201ctwisted-like\\u201d shape. When you blister them, (either on a grill or in a cast iron skillet), they get a really nice smokey aroma to them and soften just the right amount. For these peppers, I like keeping things super simple and let the peppers speak for themselves. Nothing but a little sesame oil, salt and pepper. Yum-town. Not only is this snack delicious and easily transportable (mid afternoon work snack? Yes, please), but it\\u2019s seriously a 10 minute recipe from start to finish. I\\u2019m pretty sure these are going to be my new go to healthy snack and hopefully they\\u2019re Roy Choi approved. :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny\"]'),(283,'Cornmeal Crusted Mustard Shrimp','[\"That is why today I happy we are sharing this great Cornmeal Mustard Shrimp recipe with you.\",\"These two things married with shrimp it becomes one of those killer must try appetizer situations.\"]',69,'{\"sodium\":2484.82,\"sugars\":157.70552,\"calories\":855.213,\"dietary_fiber\":16.6406,\"total_fat\":12.44773,\"cholesterol\":12.18,\"saturated_fat\":3.246358,\"calories_from_fat\":112.02956999999999,\"protein\":11.24959,\"total_carbohydrate\":207.16982000000002}','http://spoonforkbacon.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cornmeal-crusted-mustard-shrimp-recipe.jpg','http://www.spoonforkbacon.com/2013/03/cornmeal-crusted-mustard-shrimp/','{\"garlic powder\":[\"teaspoon\",2.0],\"vegetable oil\":[\"\",0.0],\"pepper\":[\"\",0.0],\"sour cream\":[\"tablespoon\",2.0],\"lemon\":[\"\",1.5],\"dijon mustard\":[\"tablespoon\",2.5],\"salt\":[\"\",1.0],\"onion powder\":[\"teaspoon\",2.0],\"clove\":[\"\",6.0],\"paprika\":[\"teaspoon\",1.0],\"honey\":[\"teaspoon\",0.5],\"all purpose flour\":[\"cup\",0.75],\"black pepper\":[\"teaspoon\",0.5],\"oregano\":[\"teaspoon\",1.0],\"mayonnaise\":[\"cup\",0.5],\"cayenne pepper\":[\"teaspoon\",0.5],\"egg\":[\"\",1.0],\"lemon juice\":[\"teaspoon\",2.0],\"shrimp\":[\"lb.\",0.5]}','[\"triple blanched garlic aioli:\",\"6 cloves garlic\",\"1/2 cup mayonnaise\",\"2 tablespoons sour cream\",\"1/2 lemon, juiced\",\"salt and pepper to taste\",\"2 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, divided\",\"2 teaspoons lemon juice\",\"1 teaspoon fresh oregano, minced\",\"1/2 teaspoon honey\",\"1/2 lb. shrimp (21-26 count), shelled with tails intact, deveined and cleaned\",\"3/4 cup all purpose flour\",\"1 egg, lightly beaten\",\"1 cup medium to finely ground cornmeal (depending on preference)\",\"2 teaspoons garlic powder\",\"2 teaspoons onion powder\",\"1 teaspoons salt\",\"1 teaspoon smoked paprika\",\"1/2 teaspoon black pepper\",\"1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\",\"1 lemon, thinly sliced\",\"vegetable oil for frying\"]','[\"1.

We went to town and bought a million different kinds of sanding sugars, dragees, jimmies, and luster dusts. We had the best time meeting and decorating cookies with the other ladies at the event. We thought it would be really fun to share with you our sugar cookie recipe and some tips and tricks so you can host your own cookie decorating party!\",\"Because we were throwing this cookie party to celebrate EXPRESS and their new holiday collection, we thought it would be cute to have fashion cookies. So we got a bunch of cookie cutters in the shape of t shirts, high heels, dresses, and skirts. We pre-flooded everything so that by the time the party started people could get straight down to the fun part, which is decorating. It was so cool to see how creative people got with the decorations on their cookies.\",\"We also made really cute take home bags so people could travel with their newly decorated cookies. The bags may look fancy, but they are so easy to make! All we did was run some white kraft paper goodie bags through our printer and printed out some circle labels. If you want to get really crafty, we cut out a little paper ribbon our of paper we printed a pattern on to use for a little color and extra decoration.\",\"If you guys are thinking about throwing your own cookie decorating party, here are some quick and easy cookie decorating tips to help you guys get the best results!\",\"-\",\" this particular icing can seem intimidating, but trust us, its totally not! The recipe we provided gives you a stiff icing, perfect for piping lines and creating detail work.\",\"-When working with royal icing, it\\u2019s best to first divide your batch into small bowls and create all your desired colors (if you\\u2019re using professional grade gel colors, begin using a tiny bit at a time and continue to add more and more as you need it. It\\u2019s so concentrated that the nice shade of baby pink you were going for will suddenly be hot pink before you know it! I usually dip the end of a bamboo skewer into the gel colors and dab my icing and mix. I do this until I get the color I want\\u2026little by little.\",\"-Once you\\u2019ve loaded your piping bags and are ready to begin decorating, remember that you\\u2019ll get a better result when your tip doesn\\u2019t actually touch the surface of the cookie. You want to sort of \\u2018air\\u2019 drag the line of icing to create a border or any detailed work.\",\"-flooding cookies: once you\\u2019ve created a border and it has fully dried, you are ready to add a small amount of water to your icing to loosen it and then pour it into the area you want filled. I like to use my finger to spread the icing around and a toothpick for smaller areas.\\u00a0 The icing must dry completely before you can begin decorating.\",\"-it\\u2019s fun to paint the surface with luster dust and we used it like paint by dabbing a small amount onto a paint brush and painting it on dry as well as adding a small amount of alcohol to the luster dust to make it more concentrated/deeper colors\\u2026just play around and have fun with it!\",\"-since we brought all the cookies pre-baked and flooded with plain black and white surfaces, we also created what we called our \\u201cglue\\u201d for the evening. It was a super loose royal icing (1/2 cup royal icing plus 2 1/2 tablespoons water) that we used by dabbing onto a paint brush and gently brushing onto the cookies to allow sprinkles and other decorations to properly stick to the surface.\",\"-patience is key here! I know that sucks, but you\\u2019ll really achieve the best results if you wait for each application to dry before moving onto the next!

It smelled horrible in there. Like cleaning solution and disgusting food. So naturally as a brat, I complained SO MUCH when I had to go. So my Mom would always give me a cookie from her coffee cart.
