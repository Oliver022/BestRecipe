VI have always loved that the Persian New Year, Norooz , coincides with the beginning of spring. It feels right, to begin the year anew now, when everything is crawling out from the heavy cloak of winter, the year\u2019s new growth tentatively unfurling. It is the easiest time to slough off the old and look forward. Every year I am dumbfounded by the proliferation of the green and the fresh: the fluorescent tips of spruce and pine and the baby nettle plants poking out everywhere in the hills of Marin, the flower blossoms and flowering bulbs and tiny tree buds in San Francisco, the doves who announce their arrival on my deck daily and circle each other awkwardly before surprising into flight at the sight of a crow. That, coupled with the miracle that is that extra hour of golden light following daylight savings, makes this time of year a little intoxicating. I feel like I\u2019m floating through the days, and those days are full of possibility. There is nothing more perfect with which to celebrate this greenest season than the Persian  kuku sabzi , an herbed frittata of sorts that is, as my pal Samin describes it,  \u201cmostly greens and herbs \u2026. just barely bound together with egg, so it\u2019s like eating a mouthful of greens.\u201d  It\u2019s a traditional dish served at Norooz, the green herbs and eggs a perfect iteration of renewal. I would like a mouthful of greens with a lacy web of golden eggs barely holding it together. It\u2019s a flexible and forgiving dish \u2013 frequently it\u2019s made with parsley, cilantro, dill and chives, but nearly anything leafy and green is welcome. I folded some pea and fava shoots into it \u2013 they are my own signifiers of spring. I love their subtle legume flavor and they worked beautifully in this context. Add whatever bright, delicate herbs or greens you like. Here\u2019s to every green thing, and to long evenings, and to the possibility of the new.

VThere\u2019s that palpable change happening again \u2013 a sense of building anticipation and elation as the weather warms. On Monday evening while driving to a friend\u2019s, it struck me how odd and wonderful it was that at 7:30 pm there was a golden evening glow about the sky \u2013 it felt too late to still be light out, but here we are. I had made my peace with those early dark nights \u2013 as I do every winter \u2013 because I kind of enjoy them for a little while, and because there\u2019s no escaping them. But when these long evenings return it feels like falling in love. San Francisco\u2019s been in the grip of an early little burst of heat, and the city comes alive under its magnificent spell. There\u2019s an electricity in the air, a sense of togetherness in our hustle, a sense of  anything-is-possible-ness . It\u2019s invigorating.  So I\u2019m spending my evenings outside on the deck, resurrecting my little garden, marveling at a breathtaking city view that I try not to take for granted after five years here, and turning on the stove as little as possible. I love this time of year.  In April,  Maggie Battista  and I adventured out to Berkeley Bowl \u2013 perhaps one of the best local spots to take anyone enthusiastic about food, and especially produce. It\u2019s unmatched in variety and weirdness. We got some green almonds there. She brought hers back with her on the plane \u2013 I like anyone who brings food home from travels. That Friday I dined at one of my favorite local spots,  Heirloom Cafe . I had been mulling what to make with those green almonds until I had some roasted asparagus dressed with a gorgeous s alsa rustica  there. While there were no green almonds in theirs, it was totally obvious that a  salsa rustica  was the perfect home for these tart, crunchy young almonds.  Happy Spring, gang! Happy Friday. Hope you all have a fantastic weekend.

VMaybe the holiday magic is in the mess  I read this late on December 24th, and wished that I had read it earlier. Wished that I had been carrying it around with me throughout the month, reminding myself of this every damn time things got messy. Because it was a messy month.  Christmas brings out an exuberance in me unique to this time of year. I love everything about the season: the deep universality of celebrating light in darkness; the jolly, rotund figure of Santa and all that that merriment embodies. I love the pagan roots connected to the winter solstice, and the Norse influence of stern, fatherly figures and fir trees. I love how wild and ancient it feels to bring a living tree into the home, and dress it up, and make it bright. I love the lights and the glitter and the sparkle and the glass ornaments and the profusion of sweets and cookies. I love the connotations of the season, the pageantry, the use of story to convey the big stuff. I love the sappy sentimentality of Christmas carols, and I love to imagine Santa\u2019s journey across the globe, impossible as it is. And because I love all of that so much, I wanted this year to be motherfucking perfect. I wanted to have the time and the space to do it on my terms.  What comes next is likely obvious. My plan to have the schedule cleared after the 13th, to dedicate myself to holiday spiriting, cookie baking, card writing, and general magic: totally didn\u2019t happen like that. I got lost in a stressful tangle of interpersonal challenges, unexpected piles of work, getting sick, feeling raw and tired and kinda ragged. I got all sad and sorry for myself. I declared, privately, that I had lost the holiday spirit this year.  And then, on Christmas day, cooking with my stepmother, quietly in sync in the kitchen, feeling relief that the storm had passed, I finally grabbed onto that holiday spirit a little bit. My family is so kind. They took such good care of me. And perhaps that\u2019s what I needed: some nourishment, some care. We had a mellow, lovely, unmessy feast at the table. And we finished our Christmas dinner with this cake. Their enthusiasm for it made me blush.  This cake is very much of the season but wouldn\u2019t be out of place as part of a quiet January brunch. It\u2019s rich with the hallmarks of December: heavy on the spices (inspired, in fact, by gingerbread cookie spices), tangy with tart bursts of fresh cranberries (go buy them now while they\u2019re on sale and before they\u2019re gone!), laced with citrus notes from fresh orange zest and juice, warm with toasted almonds, and a little fancy with that powdered sugar finish. But make no mistake: this is an easy cake, and a little messy, just like the holidays, and perhaps because it\u2019s flourless. It tastes equally good with a cup of coffee or a glass of champagne, which is to say, eat it as enthusiastically at breakfast as you would at dessert. I had intended to get this cake to you before December 25th, but, you know, things got messy. Blessedly so.

VThinking about  eating well on the road  was so easy during the summer. So many towns have a farmers\u2019 market worth visiting, and putting together a huge impromptu salad is a breeze when the produce is abundant. Plus, it\u2019s inherently tied to summer travel adventures, which are a very different kind of travel than the kind of travel we do at the holidays. It\u2019s the kind of travel that embraces all that is carefree about the season. Not so much this time of year. But I really think that it\u2019s now that we need to eat well on the road (and at home). Now, with all the inherent stresses of holidays and ridiculously harried airports. Now, with the glut of holiday food coming our way, delicious though it may be. And now, with the onslaught of colds and flus, it just feels good to take care of ourselves. To be kind.  I\u2019ve been eating oatmeal every morning. It\u2019s just the best when it\u2019s cold out, especially with this winning formula. I have a generous hand with the spices, and I make sure to add some nuts for crunch and protein, and some kind of fruit, dried or fresh, and a heaping tablespoon of crystallized ginger to elevate it from bland porridge to special bowl of coziness. This recipe is my everyday standard, and I love how easily and how well it translates for travel. Throw it in a ziploc bag and take it with you next week if you\u2019re headed somewhere for Thanksgiving. Or have a bowl before you head off to work. It happens to taste just as good at home.

VEvery year, at some point during the months of September and October, San Francisco cycles through a few warm periods.  It\u2019s our summer! , we like to say. We always regard these as the best months the city has to offer. The fog lifts for a period, the air crackles with a dry autumnal spark, and there are days that feel almost, almost like summer, except that the light is paler and golden, slanted, and night comes so much sooner. It\u2019s our reward for a lot of grey during the summer.  I learned that  these little mini summers have as many names as there are words for snow. In some countries, these fleeting warm spells are named after their saint days: there is  brittsommar  in Sweden and Michael\u2019s or Miguel\u2019s or Michel\u2019s Little Summer. In Germany, it\u2019s called Golden October. Much of eastern Europe refers to it as Old Ladies\u2019 Summer. I like that one especially. By my favorite is this:  Veranillo del Membrillo , or Little Summer of the Quince. The occasion is anchored to the harvest, and the ephemeral fruits of the season.  And so, these funny little pancakes. Anchored to the spirit of the season (the warm, smoky spices and the roasted veg), but not at all out of place for lunch on an unusually warm day. The pancakes are inspired by the Italian flatbread socca, made only of chickpea flour, olive oil, water, and salt. They\u2019re addictively good \u2013 deeply savory and nutty.

VWell, it\u2019s that time of year again. Take a deep breath. Everybody hold hands. We can do this. How we navigate this ridiculous, glorious and challenging time of year is a theme I will probably stay with through most of December. I\u2019m in the thick of three big projects in addition to my  cookbook  and this site, and I just want to stay sane. To breathe. I want to enjoy the heck out of my favorite month.  And perhaps because this month starts with my birthday and finishes with New Year\u2019s Eve, I\u2019m extra inclined to treat myself. I\u2019m really enamored with holding on to the little things to keep that sense of calm and wonderment. Giving ourselves little gifts counts, on my list, among the things that we need to stay sane right now. I\u2019m not talking about ridiculous shopping sprees or extravagant purchases. I\u2019m talking about treating ourselves to things that make us happy, that enrich us a little:  a wholesome midweek dinner with a little side of broccolini tossed with smoked paprika, a really lovely bar of dark chocolate, a huge bag of Satsuma mandarins, or a new cookbook to browse before bed. Or perhaps it\u2019s one hour of yoga. Or a long walk at dusk. Or a half hour spent listening to your favorite album. I say hoard those things. Be selfish about them. It makes us less selfish elsewhere in our lives.  So in the spirit of treating ourselves, and because I love the community that  Food52  has cultivated, I\u2019ve decided to go for it, to offer my very first ever giveaway: Food52\u2032s newest cookbook! There are not one but two copies up for the offering. So do it. Treat yourself a little. Just leave a comment below between now and Wednesday, December 5th at 9 PM PST to be entered.

VI decided to take the long way home yesterday, after a cancelled appointment left a large window of free time between my weekend snowshoeing in Lassen and my return to the city. I never regret taking the long way if it involves driving through National Forests, along river roads and migratory bird flyways and grand swaths of California orchards in full bursts of bright white blossom.  It was almost heartbreaking in its calm evening perfection: the sky a wash of deep pinks and soft blues, reflected like liquid rosy gold in the meandering Sacramento river, a huge, soft spring moon coming up over the hills, and the washed-out colors of valley agriculture, of grains and fields, glowing at dusk. It just makes my heart swell. Makes me have so much love for this crazy, glorious, bountiful, complex state. I find that I need these moments so much more now than ever before \u2013 they\u2019re an antidote to the mental focus required in the making of this  cookbook . But let me make clear: I am really and truly and deeply loving the work of the cookbook. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think that I have ever taken on something that requires so much strategizing and orchestration, so much mental acuity. It is daunting, sometimes overwhelming. So I go to the woods and do things that force all of my focus very intensely into the present: snowshoeing, rock climbing. Or I go to the yoga mat. Or I drive along empty farm roads at dusk. These things fill me up and have never felt more necessary or dear.  A couple weeks ago I started to crave this funny roasted banana dish that I remembered from childhood. It\u2019s comforting, perhaps because of the memory of it coming out of the broiler as a kid, though my dad has no recollection of it, and I don\u2019t know where it came from or why we ended up roasting bananas at all. I think that our dad was trying to cleverly trick us into eating a healthy dessert. No matter, really. I fancied it up with cocoa nibs and pistachios, giving it just the right balance of rich, creamy banana flavor and sharp, bittersweet crunch. Perhaps it\u2019s a little like a deconstructed sundae?

VWhat is it about pumpkins? They seem to possess this magical power over a certain cross-section of the population, reducing us to high-pitched cooing and uninhibited enthusiasm. I am all for enthusiasm. But can you think of any other fruit or vegetable that does this to us? I can\u2019t.  A couple weekends ago on a farm tour, we stopped at the Petaluma Creamery. They had pumpkin ice cream. But ice cream reliably upsets my tummy so I was determined this year to bond deeply with pumpkin in a sweet and sugary frozen form without any unwelcome side effects. And here we are. While this ambrosial mixture was warming on the stove, the fragrance reminded me of a Thai pumpkin curry \u2013 one of my favorite foods. Frozen, it loses some of that, which is perhaps for the best. But I wonder what might happen if a little heat were thrown in, or even a little lemongrass? There are so many possibilities.

VI have a thing for this time of year \u2013 starting this week and sweeping all the way through to the end of December. All of its sparkly, wondrous, glittering, cozy magic. If I had my druthers, I would lay for hours beneath a Christmas tree, inhaling its piney aroma, listening to old Christmas records, and sipping champagne (or tea, or mulled cider.) Having these little moments to myself takes the edge off the craziness of this time of year, and I guard them fiercely. My goal this December, as every year, is to not let the frustrating parts of the month get the better of the best parts of the month. It takes a little dedication to do that. Keeping afloat and keeping calm doesn\u2019t just happen by itself. So I grab on to little things that remind me throughout the day. Receiving Nicole\u2019s  wonderful newsletter  this morning is exactly the kind of thing I\u2019m holding on to. I hope you do too. And these sparkling cranberries are everything that is good and wonderful about this time of year. They\u2019re gorgeous as a decorative element and even better because they\u2019re edible. You get a wash of sweetness followed by an intense, puckery, tart burst. It\u2019s a stellar combination. Set them out on the table or skewer them on a fancy toothpick to float over your favorite cocktail.

VOne of the greatest takeaways from my time in Montana is how crazy lucky I am to have such an abundance of produce available here in northern California. My last week there, I stayed in a little detached cabin on a small property in the Bitterroot valley, hunkered down for a week of projects.  The people who owned the place \u2013 kind, warm folks who shared their unparalleled farm eggs with me, milk from their goats, and their raspberries \u2013 had a garden overflowing with late summer and early fall produce. And it really blew my mind that those gorgeous little sungold tomatoes just coming into their own were already at risk of an abrupt end because the first frost was threatening, nightly, in the forecast.  I get it now, why some of you grumble at the wealth of fresh produce that I flaunt on this site all winter long. While tomatoes in winter are like zombie versions of their summer selves, so much that you can\u2019t get elsewhere isn\u2019t: our citrus, our pomegranates, our greens, our avocados. I know, you can get these things anywhere, but it\u2019s not the same when it\u2019s been shipped one thousand miles. This winter I will try to be humble in sharing my vegetal riches.  In the meanwhile, I\u2019m so taken with the unique transition September provides: our late-summer produce is still going strong, but the subtle turn in weather has me running towards comfort foods. My friend Nicole smartly called polenta  Italian mashed potatoes  \u2013 and she\u2019s so right about that one. They\u2019re rich and creamy and comforting in a way that other grains aren\u2019t. And a perfect vehicle for the latter days of our cherry tomatoes and fresh shell beans.

aVNext, prepare the polenta. Add four cups of water to a medium large pot, along with the polenta. Bring to a low simmer, stirring frequently so the polenta doesn\u2019t burn. When the water has absorbed and the grain is cooked, turn off heat. Add the parmesan cheese, a generous quantity of black pepper, and salt to your liking. \u000a

aVIn a large skillet, heat some olive oil over a low flame. Add the teaspoon of za\u2019atar and the beans. Saute the beans for a few more minutes with the za\u2019atar. \u000a

V(First, WOW. Thank you, all, for your congratulations, well wishes and kind words about my cookbook project. Way to make a girl\u2019s week! I am so excited for the year ahead, and your enthusiasm is like having my own personal cheering squad. THANK YOU! It\u2019s a tremendous feeling.) Last Sunday I went on a  farm tour . We boarded a bus in San Francisco, made our way through the city, over the foggy bridge, through the moodily gorgeous Marin headlands and up into Petaluma farmland. It\u2019s remarkable country, close enough to the coast to entertain the Pacific fog daily, and far enough inland for perfect warm days.  David Little talks about dry farming Pulling sunchokes from the ground Little Organic Farm , our first stop, practices dry farming. That is, they don\u2019t water their crops. Crazy, right? But in a place like California, with urgent water issues, the perennial threat of drought, and a long, rainless summer, dry farming is smart. The top layer of soil is compacted after spring rains to seal moisture in the deeper layers of soil. This yields smaller produce with a more intense, concentrated flavor. And given the nationwide drought issues this year, it seems a smart solution to huge water shortages.  Dry farmed potatoes from Little Organic Okay, let\u2019s talk about this salad. This salad is perfection. Roasted potatoes in a salad? Genius. It is a perfect union of the gratifying comforts of potatoes with the wholesome satisfaction of a salad. And the delicata squash are roasted to caramelized perfection, and the arugula and pomegranate seeds just send it out of the park. It makes a huge quantity \u2013 one that will disappear surprisingly fast.

VIn keeping with my  epic summer goals , last weekend was spent in Yosemite. One could argue that it was work-related, sort of: I made some  breakfast burritos  for this week\u2019s Etsy post, and those needed to be field-tested by hungry folks who had come from a long day of hiking and climbing.  This week I\u2019ve been back in the thick of it, cooking and shooting lots of beautiful recipes, and sneaking in a few stolen moments to enjoy a little bit of summer. I\u2019m pretty certain that one of the best things to pair with a stolen summer moment is a grilled peach with some goat milk ice cream. I\u2019ve kinda got a thing for goat milk ice cream. It\u2019s a little bit lighter, and there\u2019s a subtle tang to it, but its texture and flavor hold up well in any context where you\u2019d reach for a beautifully made vanilla ice cream. And grilled peaches, well. You get these caramelized edges, a hint of sweet, and a little bit of the fruit\u2019s tart undertones. I glazed them with a little olive oil, raspberry vinegar, and a sprinkle of coarse sugar and cardamom. And they were heavenly.  This is part of my new summer series  Eating Well on the Road

VTwo and a half years ago, I made a  promise to you to write about how to shuck an oyster . I am finally making good on that promise.  Oysters are magnificent, magical, wonderful things \u2013 kind of like drugs but with no deleterious side effects or risk of physical addiction. I am not one to attribute mind-altering qualities to food, but oysters are an exception. Oysters transcend food. I am a full believer in the magical powers of these briny little mollusks. Aside from their potent euphoria-inducing qualities, they\u2019re  sustainable as all get out , filtering the water of the bays they inhabit and enriching sea beds with their shells after consumption. And  they\u2019re good for you too . They are, in short, an ideal thing to consume.  (We are lucky enough to have beautiful Tomales Bay an hour\u2019s drive north, where some of the west coast\u2019s finest oysters can be found.) Shucking, once you get the hang of it, is so much fun. There\u2019s a satisfaction in having done a little work for your bivalve reward.  A fresh oyster should taste clean and briny, like the best smelling ocean ever, with no trace of rotting marine life.  HOW TO SHUCK AN OYSTER You will need:

VThe most important thing to remember is to not use much force. You may think that you have to jam that oyster knife in that shell with all of your might, but you don\u2019t. \u000a
p688
aVGentle persistence\u000a
p689
aV is key, not only to successfully opening the shell, but to avoiding injury. \u000a
p690
aVHave the flatter side of the oyster facing up, and the cupped side facing down. Rest the oyster on a stable surface, cover half with a cloth, and stabilize with one hand. \u000a
p691
aV1. Find the hinge of the oyster: this is the narrower, pointier end of the oyster. Gently ease the tip of the oyster knife into the hinge. Sometimes bits of the shell will flake off, and sometimes you will need to flake off a little of the shell to get in there. It flakes off pretty easily. Don\u2019t worry about that, but try not to let any get inside the shell.\u000a
p692
aV2. This is the most important moment: to get in there, gently twist the oyster knife back and forth, as if you were turning a screwdriver back and forth in your hand. You can be firm, but don\u2019t force anything. \u000a
p693
aVKeep twisting the knife back and forth in a semi-circular motion. Don\u2019t angle it up and down like a lever. Imagine a circle. Or, imagine you are \u000a
p694
aVturning a key in an ignition\u000a
p695
aV. You will feel the shell start to release a little. Keep at it, gently, until the you can get the knife all the way in there. \u000a
p696
aV3. Slide the knife along the inside of the top shell to dislodge the adductor muscle from the shell. You can now remove the top shell entirely. \u000a
p697
aV4. Carefully holding the oyster so as not to lose any of the precious liquor (that delicious juice inside the shell), slide the knife under the body of the oyster to remove it from the bottom shell and ease its path into your mouth. \u000a
p698
aV5. Dress the oyster with any of these: mignonette (I love my friend Anna\u2019s \u000a
p699
aVsimple recipe\u000a
p700
aV), lemon juice, hot sauce, or horseradish. I\u2019m on a hot sauce and lemon juice kick right now. It just needs a little acid to boost its gentle briny flavors. \u000a

VI have been thinking a lot about  this sentence You spend the first half of your life running away from home and the second half trying to get back to home.  I\u2019ve been thinking about it because of my propensity to run away from home every summer. But I have a slightly different take on it: I think that the running from home is also a running towards something that brings home into sharper focus.  Going to  Glacier  every summer has become a ritual. I go there to get back to me at my best, to shed some of the things that burden all of us in life \u2013 our fears, our hurts, our anxieties. And I go there to focus, very simply, on the daily act of walking, of observing wilderness at its best, of challenging myself in the most straightforward of ways: can I make it up that 2500 foot climb with a backpack on? God damn it, I can.  I go there to be inspired, to be filled up, to meet interesting and colorful folks, to see grizzly bears and fragile melting glaciers, to hear a loon on a lake at dusk, to not think about food much except in terms of how I can be sated, to be reminded of how unbelievably huge wilderness can be, and how lucky I am to witness it, and walk in it, and be a part of it. Coming home, I didn\u2019t think that I missed anything yet. But that first night back, I surprised myself: the cool, marine breeze coming through the window was welcome, a thing that I had forgotten I enjoyed. San Francisco\u2019s bright, foggy light \u2013 so much a love/hate relationship with me \u2013 caught me off guard with its loveliness. Point is, there are comforts in home that are easy to forget when in a place as breathtakingly all-consuming as Glacier. Being pleasantly surprised by how nice those comforts feel on returning is even better.  And these Zucchini Bread Bites, from  Sara and Hugh\u2019s  stunning, inspired new  cookbook  (it arrived an hour before I left on my trip \u2013 fortuitous timing!) are exactly the kind of cozy comfort I want to return home to, here on the cusp of fall, with summer produce still going strong. Zucchini bread takes me right back to my childhood. And these bring me there too, but with a twist: there is a richness with the addition of cocoa powder, and the quinoa flakes and oat flour are wholesome whole grain goodness at its best. Happy homecoming.  (PS: The title of this post is from a  song by Akron/Family

VThis year, for me, seems to be defined by my comfort zone and its boundaries. I\u2019ve been hungrily collecting those quotes, you know the ones, things like  If it doesn\u2019t scare you, it\u2019s not worth the effort . And whatnot. Well, last weekend I taught my very first class ever \u2013 on the basics of food photography. And it scared the crap out of me. (Also I was really thrilled about it.) But I think it\u2019s a good thing, to live at that edge and learn to be a little more flexible, even as I feel myself resisting in a panic, and worn down on some days because of it. I can also see how much growing I\u2019ve done and how much more enthusiastic I am about life, generally, because I am going after the things I love. High five to that. I have always wanted to teach, but hadn\u2019t felt ready to assume that role. It takes a while to feel like you\u2019re good enough at a thing to be able to offer something of value. There is theater in teaching, in leading a group and in commanding a certain confidence. I\u2019m not quite sure that I was as dynamic and on point as I had envisioned myself being, but one can\u2019t expect to be perfect on the first try. People learned stuff. Questions were asked and I was able to answer them. That felt good.  We find comfort in food for so many reasons, and lately it seems to be the familiar anchor that keeps me on the ground when so much of my life is a string of (exciting) unknowns. So, again, with these guys. Their delivery is novel, which I love about them, but the flavors are classic: cocoa, ginger and pear work easily together and their warm, spicy crunch is so perfect this time of year. And that rich aromatic fragrance, as they bake slowly in a low oven for an hour? It\u2019s to die for.

VIf you had asked me three weeks ago what I thought about rock climbing, I would\u2019ve likely answered,  Eh, not for me.  It looks hard \u2013 hard and scary and unfun. Then I found myself in the company of a bunch of climbers for a couple of weeks. It felt cultish, their specialized language and single-minded obsession with the sport. And their dogged persistance to get me to try. I can be stubborn sometimes, and I resisted. But I guess they knew that while it  is  hard and scary and sometimes unfun, it\u2019s also incredibly, unbelievably gratifying. In a way that nothing else I\u2019ve experienced is.  (Smith Rocks, Oregon.) There is really very little in life that can be likened to the experience of clinging to a rock fifty feet off the ground, the toes gripping a couple awkward nubby protrusions and the hands desperately tracing the rock for something to hold. The body\u2019s impulse is to panic \u2013 calves shake, hands grip harder, breath quickens \u2013 and it\u2019s hard for the mind to override that. I knew that I wasn\u2019t unsafe, given that I was strapped into a very reassuring harness, but my body didn\u2019t totally believe that. Not most of the time anyway.  (That\u2019s me!) Doing something like that, taking a chance on something I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t like and then discovering that I  do  like it, in spite of myself, is a little bit life-changing. This is a big part of why I travel: to be surprised. I give myself over to unfamiliar situations and I really have no idea what will happen \u2013 there is no predicting who I will meet or what will transpire. And that always shakes me up, typically for the better. I like having the boundaries of my comfort zone flexed, despite some stubborn tendencies. And I like surprising myself.  And this grilled cheese? It sits squarely in the comfort zone, and that\u2019s not a bad thing at all. It was enthusiastically appreciated at the end of a long day. It was a collaborative effort. It wasn\u2019t planned. Cherry tomatoes travel well, as does arugula, surprisingly, and any hard cheese, unsurprisingly. I think the key to the success of this one was to pair two kinds of strong cheese and play them against the sweet of the tomatoes and the spicy of the arugula. That, and a huge appetite after an active day. That always helps.  This is part of my new summer series  Eating Well on the Road

Now that I\u2019ve made them, I can say with certainty that they are indeed genius. Just three ingredients come together to create something much greater than the sum of its parts. It\u2019s such a winning, clever, well-executed treat. You could serve it before a meal or after. Use a strong goat cheese and the best honey you can find. Gather some friends to help. And do your best to not eat all of them in one sitting. They are as addictively good as they sound.

VMy cousin once told me that looking at the photos on this site gave the impression that I live in a vast, high-ceilinged, impressively white space, filled with gauzy, billowing curtains, white furniture and polished wood floors. It was totally inaccurate, of course, but it was flattering that my photographs provided such a dreamy illusion. And it reminded me of the time, years ago in art school, when a lamp that I had made was dismissed for trying to make a  silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear . It was fashioned out of old, cheap Ikea parts and fancied up with a handsome walnut veneer \u2013 and the person critiquing the work found that dishonest. I\u2019ve held on to that phrase ever since that sharp critique, almost in defiance: heck yes, I will make a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear, damn it.  So when my sweet friend  Leela Cyd  emailed in January wondering whether I\u2019d like to have my kitchen featured on the Kitchn, I kind of panicked. My kitchen is the opposite of fancy \u2013 if my photos are the silk purse, then my kitchen is the sow\u2019s ear. Thinking about documenting its imperfection gave me a tight-chested, sweaty-palmed, straight-up anxiety. There is so much that is edited out: our ridiculous brown shag wall-to-wall carpeting that has been teleported from 1979 (it pairs very well with Fleetwood Mac, though), the abundance of unsightly sprinklers attached hodgepodge all over the ceiling, the cheap cabinets, unattractive paint and generally imperfect state of our very real apartment. That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t like this place. I do. But sharing its imperfect face on the internet is another story. There is no silk purse to be made out of this sow\u2019s ear. I suppose, at the end of the day, it illustrates that a normal, awkward, dark kitchen should never be an excuse to not cook. I\u2019ve made a life around food, in this wonky kitchen with its two front burners that never light, its ghastly overhead fluorescent tubes that are never turned on but oppressive in their central overhead spot, its falling-apart cheap cabinetry and pockmarked linoleum. This is where I work. It\u2019s where I do what I love.  It\u2019s a funny coincidence that I first learned about these gorgeously-hued, intensely magenta deviled eggs from Leela\u2019s  post last year on the Kitchn.  I finally got around to making them this weekend, and bring them to you today, the day on which Leela has run the feature on  my own kitchen on the Kitchn. Deviled eggs are already a perfect party food. Add this bright shot of color to the mix and you\u2019ve taken them to another level of wow. In researching these guys I learned that the tradition of beet-pickled deviled eggs is a big one in Pennsylvania. You take a half dozen eggs, plop them in the pickled beet brine, let them sit overnight, or longer, depending on your desired hue. The lovely Ashley of  Not Without Salt  is on the same wavelength: she also  showcased some of these gorgeous pink eggs  this week, along with three other fine ways to go about a deviled egg, one of which smartly incorporates  preserved lemons . Go check it out.

p941
aVWhile the beets are cooking, prepare the eggs. Place the eggs in a pot and fill with cold water. Bring to a boil. When the water is boiling, turn off heat, cover and let sit for 12 minutes. Drain eggs and place in an ice bath to cool. Peel when cool.\u000a
p942
aVWhen the beets are soft, after about an hour or so, remove from heat, reserving the liquid. Peel skins from beets. \u000a
p943
aVIn a wide-mouth quart jar, combine the beets with one cup of the colored water, the vinegar and the black peppercorns. Add the eggs. Let the eggs sit at least overnight. Longer sitting will more deeply color and pickle the eggs. \u000a

V(First, ahem. I\u2019d like to interrupt this post with some crazy awesome news: this site is a finalist in  Saveur\u2019s Food Blog Awards ! I am so ridiculously excited and honored! I\u2019d be thrilled if you took a moment to  cast a vote for The Year in Food. Last week I was in New York. I was there for  IACP  mostly, but I was also there for impromptu lunches, meetings, quick coffees with friends, long walks through huge cross-sections of Manhattan while listening to  Paul Simon  on repeat, epic springtime blossoms, and a moment away from my day to day.  The morning that I departed for NYC, I decided to leave my laptop and camera behind. They\u2019re beasts. It was liberating. It meant that I would spend less time on the internet, and more time being present, engaged, wrapped up, a little lost but in a totally okay way. Any photos that week would be on my phone. I love being a free agent. On the plane ride home, I was exhausted. The first half was spent watching regrettable reality TV, but the second half I gave over to music and gazing out a dark, foggy plane window with occasional starburst patterns of tiny cities below. And my mind just wandered. I thought about a big project I\u2019m working on right now and all of these stray pieces just fell into place. Things started to make sense in a way that they hadn\u2019t before, and a whole bunch of new ideas materialized. It was awesome. It was surprisingly productive, even though that wasn\u2019t my intent. My point is, had my laptop been with me, I might not have let myself daydream like that \u2013 I would have felt obligated to dig in to the neverending to-do list.  So yesterday morning when I heard  Jonah Lehrer on the radio speaking about the value of daydreaming  \u2013 of having nothing to do but let your thoughts wander, and how essential that is to creativity, I felt so validated. He also spoke about how we are often most creative when we\u2019re very tired and that made me feel doubly validated. I always come up with the best ideas when flying, and I get it now: it\u2019s uninterrupted time to let my mind wander, without distraction. It\u2019s an in between space, one where some of the rules that guide our everyday lives are temporarily on hold. I guess this is why I like flying. I love daydreaming but under many circumstances it feels so self-indulgent.  This has nothing to do with these rice crackers, of course, except that healthy snacks for long travels are a must. And rice crackers not only travel well but are great vehicles for all sorts of delicious things that need an edible spoon. Most recipes call for white rice and sweet rice flour but I made these fellows with sweet brown rice and brown rice flour and guess what? They still taste great. I\u2019ve had my eye on them since spying them over at  Spoon Fork Bacon  and am so happy that I finally got around to making them.

VWhere does one begin? What it feels like is that everything in my life has led me to this exact moment, and this exact moment is right where I want to be. Two years ago, nearly to the day (October 7th), I left my job as a massage therapist because I was badly injured from too many years of demanding physical labor. My shoulder was busted. I was totally beat. Exhausted, uninspired and in a lot of pain. I remember, on the day that I stopped working, thinking that I\u2019d have about three weeks off to recuperate, and I naively believed that I could lock down a new career and a revamped blog in that short time. It took a lot longer than three weeks.  It is kind of like the perfect storm, if I can borrow that oft-used term and make it into a damn fine thing. In art school I was hopelessly preoccupied with color and light, but opted not to major in photography because I smugly thought that I knew all that I needed to know about that medium. So I pursued furniture design, which was a terrible fit. (But a wonderful group of folks to work with.) And that brought me back to food, because I wanted to invest my energy in something that felt meaningful and important, and joining my friends and family at the table around food was (and still is) a thing that makes my heart swell. So I started a blog and a project: 52 Dinners, with the aim of documenting one meal per week for a year with friends and family. It was more of an art project, originally. I didn\u2019t think about color and light for a while. I was obsessed with storytelling but didn\u2019t understand how to bring that back to my young blog, because I thought that to write about food, one had to master the nuances of flavor and talk about that in a very literal way. It\u2019s taken a long time to realize that what makes food interesting is not being great at describing flavor but being great at finding the story in it. And it\u2019s taken me a long time to realize that that old preoccupation with color and light can be found just as marvelously in examining the colors of fruits and vegetables in the soft light of an upstairs window. When I began the  Color Studies  early this year, it finally all came together.  So here we are. I have the great luck (and daunting responsibility) to spend the next year obsessing over my favorite things in life: gorgeous seasonal produce, color, light, photography, narrative. It will undoubtedly be one of the hardest thing that I\u2019ve ever done. But I just feel so damn lucky that I get to do this.  VIBRANT: A Celebration of Color and Food , will bring together my passion for the season\u2019s best produce and my deep love of color through a collection of dynamic, inspired recipes. It\u2019s slated for a Spring 2014 release. A huge thank you to Sally Ekus of Lisa Ekus Group and Lisa Westmoreland and the entire team at Ten Speed for supporting this project from the beginning.

VPreserved lemons seem so decidedly un-wintery. It\u2019s all yellows and whites, undeniably bright and warm and golden.  And yet, it\u2019s a great end-of-winter ritual, to pack the last of the season\u2019s Eureka or Meyer lemons in salt, bury them in their own juice, and let them cure in the fridge for the many warm months ahead.  Do it now, friends. You\u2019ll be so happy to have them on hand in the spring and summer. Their intense, puckery flavor is unbelievably versatile: my recent  Preserved Lemon and Chickpea Pasta  and last year\u2019s  Roast Cornish Game Hen with Preserved Lemons  (try it with chicken too!) are both testament to that.

VOver the weekend I had a quick getaway to lovely Santa Barbara for Edible Publications\u2019 annual  Edible Institute . The weekend was jam-packed, as these things go \u2013 full of smart, funny people who give a gosh darn. These are people who care deeply about food and come to the table from so many different, compelling angles.  I came away with a lot of facts: for instance, that Walmart controls 25% of the food supply chain, a frightful figure. But my greatest takeaway was the profound power of storytelling. Narrative is the most compelling way to make a point; with a story you\u2019re not preaching or lecturing or talking at a person, you\u2019re sharing. It is for this reason that those who impacted me the most this weekend were sustainable rancher  Will Harris , whose deep Georgia drawl and way with words were an absolute delight; the lovely Daniel and Mirra of  Perennial Plate , whose short videos on food producers across America are reliably funny, warm and thoughtful; and the remarkable stories told by  Tracie McMillan  (the very woman scorned last week by Rush Limbaugh for being overeducated \u2013 she has a bachelor\u2019s degree, btw) and  Jonathan Bloom , on a fantastic panel moderated by the esteemed  Barry Estabrook . Against all the clutter of the internet, these folks are worth your time.  Now, tacos. Lately I have been dreaming of tacos morning, noon and night. I cannot get enough of the flavors of cilantro, lime, onion and jalapeno, whether paired with tomatoes, or with avocados, or here, with radishes for a bright variation on a classic. These fellas are a weekday staple for me \u2013 although on busy mornings it\u2019s usually with premade salsa.  I have a small cast-iron skillet that is the perfect size for frying two eggs. After the eggs are fried I heat the tortillas in the pan to soften and warm them. Then there is salsa, hot sauce, salt and pepper and a hasty journey from the plate.  Texans may debate whether this is a true Breakfast Taco, and there are those who might call this Huevos Rancheros. That\u2019s fine. To me, they\u2019re Breakfast Tacos.

VLast September, a small publishing house reached out to me wondering whether I\u2019d be interested in creating a book about hearty, substantial salads. The easiest answer, of course, was yes. Because I love produce almost to the point of obsession, and so much of what I eat on a daily basis can be classified, loosely, as salad. But the timing wasn\u2019t right with that book, and ultimately it was decided not to proceed.  I am glad for that. I wasn\u2019t ready, then, to take on the monumental work of writing and photographing a book, though I did enjoy indulging endless brainstorms around creative salads. But also, there are people who were ready, and who were already at it. There is a small cluster of new salad books on the market, and among them  Salad for Dinner  is a standout.  It\u2019s a gorgeously produced book of classic and inventive salads, all standing up to the weight of being a meal\u2019s worth of food.  And larb, that unfortunately named but delicious dish of northern Thailand and Laos, has been on my to-make list for ages, ever since I read about it on  Orangette.  Author  Jeanne Kelley  smartly says of the dish, \u201cLarb is a dumpy name for a sexy salad.\u201d And she\u2019s right. This salad is a riot of wonderful, bright flavors: the mint and the basil, the fish sauce, the fresh lime, the lemongrass, the spicy chile and chili paste, the green onions. All the hallmarks of Thai flavors that make it so easy to be enamored with the cuisine. Even though it\u2019s a rainy day here in San Francisco, I\u2019ve got my sights on spring, on longer evenings and outdoor dining, and this salad is a nod in that direction.  Hooray! The Year in Food is a finalist in  Saveur\u2019s Best Food Blog Awards . If you feel like  casting a vote my way , I\u2019d be incredibly grateful!

VFor a number of years, I worked at a place that closed annually at the Fourth of July for a week. And I always took that week off in search of summery escapades, often north \u2013 catching up with my oldest friend in Eugene, or a firework-powered block party in Portland, or a cozy evening with sparklers on Bainbridge island. One year I celebrated Canada Day in Vancouver on July 1st before coming back for a rodeo in Salem, Oregon on the 4th.  (Vancouver) I don\u2019t work there anymore, and I kind of miss that annual tradition. But I made the most of it. And I\u2019ve already squeezed a summer\u2019s worth of adventures into this June. But it was a grand way to kick off July.  (Bainbridge Island) This year I\u2019ll be close to home, keeping it mellow on all fronts except where flavor is concerned. I\u2019m rather enamored with the partnership of corn and red peppers right now, and scheming ways to showcase them in a bajillion different summer dishes. This one right here won out. Potato salad can always use a little reinventing, right? Plus, it\u2019s kind of deeply American: you start with some patriotically-hued potatoes and the most American of side dishes, and then you take it to the next level with some very native corn and peppers (the potatoes, too!). I like that. Hope y\u2019all have a grand Fourth.

VAlright. There\u2019s this three day weekend ahead, and if the stars align, it\u2019ll be blessedly warm and filled with hours of outdoors eating \u2013 an activity I\u2019d easily rank among my top five favorite things to do. I\u2019ve been making a lot of grilled meat dishes with an eye towards this weekend and the many summer weekends to come. And I knew that this meat-heavy throwdown (coming Friday!) was in need of something non-meaty to round things out. Thus, a salad. I am pretty sure this salad would do equally well alongside some well-marinated grilled tofu, too.  It\u2019s heartier than many summer salads, which makes it a fine and generous thing to eat all by itself. It\u2019s got the best of early summer produce in a partnership that\u2019s flexible and lenient. Throw in some zucchini if you wish, or some shredded carrot. Opt for a tamer lettuce than arugula. But whatever you do, have fun with it. And try to eat it out of doors.  Also! This salad tastes a lot better at room temperature than it does chilled.

VFirst, prepare the rice. I love to use a rice cooker, but if you don\u2019t have one, combine the coconut milk, 3 ounces water, lemongrass, ginger and the rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer until the liquid has been absorbed. Refrigerate for one hour to cool. Remove the ginger and lemongrass.\u000a

aVWhile the rice is cooling, prepare the corn. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Break the ear of corn in half. Boil for about five minutes, until the rice is tender but plump. Stand one half of the corn on a cutting board, and using a sharp knife, cut along the length of the cob. Repeat with second half of corn. Set aside.\u000a

VLast week, one of my goals driving home was to gather enough elderflowers to make something \u2013 a syrup, perhaps, or an  infused vodka . The cream-colored clusters of flower heads were everywhere; it was only a matter of finding a shoulder wide enough to pull over without tumbling into a creek. The small tree is fond of damp areas, so you\u2019ll often find them near rivers, lakes and streams. Needless to say, I followed every river road that I could.  The fragrance of elderflower is succulent, honey-rich, intensely sweet. It epitomizes the word  floral . And those floral qualities are concentrated when you make this syrup. There is so much to do with them that I am committed to another trip out to the river roads and the waterways of the delta, if only to make Lottie + Doof\u2019s gorgeous, delightful-looking  elderflower fritters . And perhaps a panna cotta.  If you do decide to go on your own elderflower forage \u2013 they grow everywhere! \u2013 just make sure to know the tree you\u2019re looking for. Apparently it\u2019s  easily confused with poisonous hemlock . Both plants grow near water, though the flowers of the hemlock are shocking white, unlike the soft, buttery color of the elderflower.  You can reduce the syrup further than is called for here to make a delicate, lovely addition to waffles, pancakes, ice cream or a fruity gelato. You can add the syrup to sparkling water or sparkling wine.

VUsually when I get sick, I heed the cues from my body and chill out, hard. If circumstances allow, I will spend as much of a day as possible doing nothing. Doing nothing is good for us, and it seems that the only opportunity some of us have to do this is when sick. I will catch up on entire seasons of comedy and listen to my favorite podcasts. (I think laughing helps us get better faster.) I have always interpreted a cold or flu as an opportunity to slow down and take care of myself.  But sometimes we don\u2019t have the luxury of pausing. I woke last Friday feeling off, but powered through my morning in hopes that ignoring it would make it go away. Last Friday was the start of  Eat Retreat . A weekend that I have been looking forward to all year. No big deal at all.  By the evening I was out of sorts. A fever got the best of me and I tried to engage but focusing was a challenge. I went off to my cabin to sleep. Only, there was no sleep. I woke at one in the morning with a ridiculously quickened pulse and the sensation that nuclear waves of heat were radiating from my brain outwards. It was awful. And there was nothing there to distract me from my irrational, feverish misery.  At four in the morning, out of water and woozy and still sleepless, I got up to refill my glass. The walk to a water tap was far, and it was dark, and there were the sounds of things in the night, coyotes howling and twigs breaking and a wall of cricket chorus. I was too scared to get water. So I just sat down. I sat on the steps of the cabin and listened to the night. I listened to far-off owl calls, cautious footfalls in the dry forest duff, a wind that picked up and died, and the ceaseless and soothing cacophony of insects. Sitting there in the amazingly vibrant night time did something: it didn\u2019t break my fever but it broke my misery. I felt better. Calmed. Okay.  Getting sick without our creature comforts can be so unsettling. There was a whiny five year old inside me who just wanted internet, hot tea, a tall glass of water, and some dumb television to distract me. It was a long night. But after that pause outside in the night air, it was tolerable. I crawled back into bed, listened to  this album  on repeat, and finally, somewhere around five or six in the morning, fell asleep.  And I have been wanting to comfort myself with this chicken stock ever since.

VLet\u2019s just get this out of the way: I had never made granola before last weekend! Whether it\u2019s because I was rejecting my early hippie years or because I am more a fan of savory breakfasts, who knows. Perhaps a bit of both. But lately, I\u2019ve been hankering for sweet things at breakfast. And there\u2019s no simpler or better way to satiate that breakfasty sweet tooth than with granola.  Plus! Perhaps I was the last to figure this out, but granola is the perfect catch-all for those odds and ends that need clearing from your pantry: that last little handful of nuts, or those hemp seeds that you never know what to do with, or that jar of neglected currants. They all are waiting to be appreciated in a bowl of granola. Topping with fresh fruit is a must: strawberries are going off right now, at least on the west coast. But I can\u2019t wait to get some gorgeous peaches in a bowl of this come summer.

VIt felt like a stroke of good luck to be invited to visit  Devoto Gardens  a few weeks ago. Visiting an apple orchard was on my fall to-do list and the season was nearly up.  The Friday that I headed up to their gorgeous Sebastopol acreage, it was pouring rain. I love crazy weather, perhaps because it\u2019s so infrequent here in mild-mannered coastal California. So rain wasn\u2019t gonna stop me from this much-anticipated apple tour. And farmers, of course, are a sturdy breed. They have no choice but to tolerate unpredictable weather. So it wasn\u2019t gonna stop them either.  Hunter and Jolie are awesome. They are totally apple-obsessed, exactly the kind of folks you want to be growing and celebrating apples. They were so well-versed in the nuances of texture and flavor of all kinds of heirloom apple varieties \u2013 gorgeous, tart, complex fruits that put supermarket apples to sad shame.  And the photos that I have from the day make me so unbelievably happy. I love the dramatic moodiness of the orchard at the end of its run, the water-soaked landscape, the dedicated kitty who followed us everywhere, and their willingness to share their life and passion with me.  I wanted to make something that celebrated the hard cider \u2013  Apple Sauced  \u2013 that Hunter and Jolie create with heirloom Gravenstein apples. And this time of year, mulled cider is a comfort. It\u2019s fortified with bourbon for added oomph and spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper and ginger. It tastes like late fall heaven.

VHello, friends. I\u2019m writing from a motel in a truck stop along the I-5, somewhere in central California. I think I\u2019ve mentioned before my fondness for little respites in places most people think of as nowhere. Because sometimes what I need is a little heat, an uninterrupted sky, and a swimming pool. And I\u2019ve got those in spades.  It\u2019s something of a working vacation: I\u2019m finishing up a rather large project and wanted a place with fewer distractions and some simple rewards for my efforts.  The last few weeks have been busy, unbelievably so \u2013 lots and lots of food being cooked and photographed, much of it rich and generously flavored. When I am in the midst of so much flavor overload, I find myself wanting the simplest of foods: a bowl of oatmeal, some roasted vegetables with olive oil, salt and pepper, an egg on toast. They are the antidote to a saturated palate. Who would think that an egg on toast could be so refreshing?  And I bought these beautiful quail eggs mostly because they are striking in their dappled patterns, and I have always been curious about them. Flavor wise there is little difference between these and a hen\u2019s egg. While quail and fava greens might seem like a fancy version of simple, the essence of this lunch is anything but: just two slices of toast, a mess of sauteed greens, a slather of yogurt, an egg. Enjoy.  Elsewhere: from Harvard Common Press\u2019s BlogEats:  Eggplant, Unexpectedly from Bon Appetit: 15 Best Instagram Accounts for Food Lovers

VWhen I am in the midst of so much flavor overload, I find myself wanting the simplest of foods: a bowl of oatmeal, some roasted vegetables with olive oil, salt and pepper, an egg on toast.
p1652
aVWho would think that an egg on toast could be so refreshing?
p1653
aVAnd I bought these beautiful quail eggs mostly because they are striking in their dappled patterns, and I have always been curious about them.
p1654
aVFlavor wise there is little difference between these and a hen\u2019s egg.
p1655
aVWhile quail and fava greens might seem like a fancy version of simple, the essence of this lunch is anything but: just two slices of toast, a mess of sauteed greens, a slather of yogurt, an egg.

VIt\u2019s that time of year. The evenings are stretching out and I find myself relaxing with the knowledge that it won\u2019t be dark at 6 pm, or even 7. This lends itself to long walks with Beach House on repeat, mental reminders to appreciate that shade of blue Joan Didion was so enamored with, glasses of rose with friends before the sun has set. All kinds of awesome, in short.  There\u2019s a sense of anticipation: I know that I\u2019ll wind up somewhere hot and dry and bright, buzzing with the sounds of insects at night, relishing the welcome rituals of swimming, popsicles, American rock, campfires and other trappings of summer that make the season complete. The latest  Pictory showcase , a dreamy overview of last year\u2019s Phootcamp in Marfa, Texas, perfectly encapsulates everything that makes summer perfect. And it makes me want to get out to Marfa immediately. Who\u2019s in? If you saw Sprouted Kitchen\u2019s lovely  Roasted Strawberry Coconut Milk Ice Cream  a few weeks back, then you\u2019ll know exactly where the inspiration for these popsicles comes from. The flavor is perfect: it\u2019s decadent and creamy without any dairy, and it\u2019s rich, with edges of concentrated jammy sweetness, caramelized sugar, and a whiff of cardamom. It is what I\u2019d like to have in hand on any given warm night at any given moment this summer.

VI had grand intentions for my January first. There would be a fire in the fireplace, a copy of the Sunday NYT to peruse. I would make pho, slowly, cooking in the way that I used to cook when it was just for me, totally private and selfish and gratifying and calm. There would be an array of tools to buffer me in my day of looking back and looking forward, considering all that had transpired in 2012 and all that I might hope for in 2013.  Dandelion greens None of that happened. I still have not sat down to give a deep think about 2012, though I know that it was both the most challenging and the most rewarding year of my life. One doesn\u2019t come without the other, it seems. Instead, I browsed magazines, listened to some of  The Happiness Project . (I highly recommend it!) In the afternoon I met up with friends, ambling along quiet blocks that gave way to a surprisingly bustling Valencia street. In the evening I ducked into  Bi-Rite  and it was packed. It felt like the holidays were not quite done yet. It felt cozy.  Baby Broccoli Still, I love the quiet of January. It\u2019s a month made for celebrating the quiet things: snow, grey skies, root vegetables, long-cooked soups and braises and roasted things.  I made this pho for my parents the day after Christmas. It was exactly what we all needed: something flavorful, simple, nourishing and warming. And I made it again last week. It\u2019s pretty stellar: the elements that give pho its fragrance and complexity are intact, but the hours spent making the stock from scratch are thankfully nixed. I could see this becoming a winter staple.

VTwo weeks ago, I submitted the manuscript for my cookbook. I don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019ve had enough space from it yet to entirely understand what that means or how I feel. I\u2019m proud as heck of what I did, and relieved that the stress and anxiety are mostly over. I was in over my head a lot; it\u2019s hard to tread water in that place, but I did. Towards the end, I realized that the bulk of this year has been boot camp: recipe development boot camp and photography boot camp. I\u2019ve been deep-diving into this work, and coming up, I feel a little blinded. I\u2019ve learned a ton. I can see how my ability to think about recipes has been fine-tuned. I can see how much my photography has grown and evolved. The process, for me, was kinda like what some of my friends like to call Type 2 Fun. It was not always fun when I was in the thick of it. Sometimes it outright sucked. It was hard and stressful and overwhelming and brought all of my insecurities acutely to the surface. But in retrospect: Eff yes. It was also fun and gratifying and challenging and pushed me in ways that made me stretch. I had a hard time feeling gratitude for that while I was in the thick of it, but I\u2019m feeling it now.  Now I\u2019m out here in the deep wilds of northern Montana, where I like to get a little lost every year in order to come back to myself. It has never felt more urgent or well-deserved or perfectly-timed.  The first week of my travels were spent heading north through Oregon and Washington, catching up with old and new friends and documenting some farms for my cookbook. After so much time focused on getting the book made, all these long hours in good conversation with good people were deeply gratifying. Again and again I was on the receiving end of such kindness and giving. People feeding me, taking me in, making sure my needs were met.  You know how to eat well on the road? Reach out to folks. Your old cousins, or that awesome person you connected with once, years ago. Or, here in the 21st century, your new bestie on Instagram. Bring along a bottle of wine when you come to their table. Or some cheese. Or salt. Or blueberries. Some of the people who took me in hardly knew me, and I felt so well cared for. It was undoubtedly the best expression of the kindness of strangers. The photos interspersed here are from some of those afternoons and evenings.  Being on the road requires a little flexibility, a lesson that has been hard won on my end. It\u2019s taken me a long time to appreciate a sense of spontaneity, of trusting that where I\u2019ll sleep and what I\u2019ll eat will all work out. I love to visit the tiny health food stores that you find tucked away in the most unlikely of places. And muesli is perhaps the easiest of breakfast items to cobble together with a handful of bulk bin staples and some creative flexibility. This recipe is adapted from one that I made for Etsy last summer. I am a firm believer in the magic power of crystallized ginger in this otherwise austere breakfast. And the cacao nibs and dried cherries bring it to a place of mild, wholesome decadence. It\u2019s best with a lot of fresh fruit in the bowl. In fact, I\u2019d say that fresh fruit is mandatory.  XOXO gang. More soon.

VWhen I was nineteen, I launched my very first entrepreneurial enterprise: I started a very tiny chai-making operation. I made it in my mother\u2019s kitchen, bottled it in gallon-size milk jugs, and delivered it in the basket of my old, avocado-green Schwinn bicycle to my single client: the coffee shop where I worked at the time. I was inspired to make chai because I had a life-altering cup of it from another young company:  Nub Chai . Theirs was pretty mind blowing: it packed a ridiculously strong ginger punch, and was teeth-achingly sweet with the rich, molasses flavor of whole cane sugar. You know what they say about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery? Well, my little enterprise was just that. I wasn\u2019t really trying to make my own mind blowing cup of chai. I was trying to recreate theirs. Fast forward two years. At twenty-one I was confused and restless and searching, intently, for some kind of meaning or bigness or system or structure. I don\u2019t know what I was looking for, but I was having a hard time finding it. A friend and I schemed a three month trip to India. It was probably the craziest thing I had ever done. It was certainly the most brave and definitely the most foolhardy. And we did it. We spent three challenging, difficult, overwhelming and eye-opening months in India.  By far my favorite thing about those three months was traveling the country by train. It was an experience unto itself: a world-in-miniature happening in motion. Most of the train windows didn\u2019t have glass; they were just rectangular spaces with a metal grate, which made me feel closer to the landscape outside the car. It was a more subdued way of observing the culture, considering that nothing was censored along the tracks. Whole shanty towns sprung up along the edges of stations, and so many of the rituals of living \u2013 cleaning, cooking, fighting, sleeping and shitting \u2013 could be witnessed from the train window.  At all hours of day and night, a parade of sellers would pass through with all kinds of sweets and snacks and chai and coffee. The chai wallah called out loudly:  chai, chai; chai, chai , over and over. It was often served in little earth-colored  clay cups , and they were meant to be smashed on the tracks when you finished. I loved those little bowls and brought a few home, but I have no idea where they are now.  I hadn\u2019t made chai for years before coming upon this recipe from my friend Rachel. It tastes best if you add the milk and let it simmer all together for a little bit, as this recipe does. It\u2019s rather making me fall in love all over again. And writing about India makes me want to go back there \u2013 it\u2019s the first time since going, so very many years ago, that I\u2019ve had any desire to return. I need to gather some more of those clay cups.  Perennial Plate\u2019s recent video on  a day in India  does a pretty spot-on job of capturing the sense of the place. And  Darjeeling Limited  captures that surreal, detached world that happens so uniquely on the train in India so very well.  And speaking of tea, check out this interview with my pal Leela on

VWhen I left home to travel last month, it felt like a perfect clean slate: I had just turned in my manuscript; my most longstanding regular freelance gig, with Etsy, had come to a close; and a fledgling romance had unraveled. It was kind of liberating. I had no loose ends, and no compelling reason to stay home. I needed to get the heck out of dodge. As I do every year.  Montana has an irresistible power over me. Something in the combination of those rich, jagged mountains laced with snowfields and receding glaciers, in the completeness of its wilderness. The grizzly bears and the wolves and the moose make the place feel so much more wild, and it makes me feel so much more alive. I don\u2019t know how else to say it except that going to Glacier feels like pilgrimage, and those mountains feel like church to me. I go there to worship. And be in awe. Every year I meet other folks there who come back, again and again, as I do, because it keeps calling us back. It makes me happy to know there are other people who are completely slayed, in the best possible way, by this magnificent wilderness.  After I left Montana, and after a brief but awesome visit with  Kelsey  in Denver, I was on my own. My travels went from purposeful to drifting. There was a restlessness. I wanted to get lost in the west; to test the limits of my lack of homesickness. It\u2019s hard to face that open space,  Neil Young sings. And there it was. The open space of being in between things. There was no man to return to in San Francisco, there were no freelance gigs lined up, no great project to preoccupy my mind. I had spent so much of this year singularly focused on the making of a book, and that focus provided a great sense of purpose. What next? It\u2019s an awkward moment. A pause. But we all arrive at those pauses. So I took a cautious look at that unease and that restlessness. And I knew it was time to make my way home.  Looking at that open space, that unease, that limbo, somehow was enough.  Hello. I see you.  It made coming home a little sweeter. Reminded me that there were things that I was excited to return home to. Like my friends. And the magic of September in San Francisco. And all of our fresh produce. I really missed the produce. So here I am, navigating an undefined space in my life, moving towards the start of whatever is next, enjoying a season between two seasons.  The first week of my trip was spent meandering through the Pacific Northwest and documenting farms for my cookbook. I stopped in Olympia to visit with Emily of  Board and Bread . We picked blueberries from the u-pick fields behind her home. She made me lunch. Honestly, there is nothing more kind or appreciated than getting to eat a home-cooked meal while traveling. And I loved her clever use of squash in place of pasta in this recipe from  Jerusalem . At the end of the summer squash season, when you might still have a surplus of squash but are a little fatigued on its flavor, this is the perfect way to put a couple pounds of zucchini to good use.

VSomehow, nearly two years have passed since I gave up eating wheat, and I\u2019ve managed to navigate around that discussion right here, the very place where I talk about food. There are a lot of reasons for not addressing it. I didn\u2019t trust that I\u2019d stick with it. I wasn\u2019t diagnosed Celiac. I didn\u2019t want to be judged. I\u2019ve always wanted this site to be taken at face value, and not through the lens of gluten-free. In life, especially where food is involved, I have to confront the anxiety around not wanting to inconvenience people and not wanting to be judged on the regular. I don\u2019t love having to speak up at a restaurant and say,  I\u2019m gluten-intolerant, does this have wheat?  Once at an event, right after asking about gluten-free choices, a woman next to me, a woman that I did not know, said to anyone in earshot, \u201cAnytime someone says something\u2019s gluten-free, I always ask,  Can I get extra gluten on that? Will you serve that with a side of wheat? I can be as judgey as the next person. But shaming moments like that are kind of a reminder that we never know the circumstances around another person\u2019s behavior and choices. Do you know how many times people have said to me,  I could never give up bread or pasta!  I didn\u2019t want to give up bread or pasta either. But I had to. The flip side is that the gluten-free thing is having a moment. There is so much available, and so much experimentation, and it\u2019s awesome.  My symptoms exist in that nebulous zone of gluten-intolerance. Mostly they were debilitating digestive troubles. They\u2019re so much better now that I easily forget how awful I felt, how debilitating it was, and how much it limited my ability to thrive. We all deserve a chance at thriving. And I have always imagined this space as one of celebration: a celebration of the seasons, the foods that I love, the produce and the farms and the farmers who inspire me, and my favorite places. Now I\u2019d like to be a little more transparent about celebrating the gluten-free thing too.  Brown rice and oat flour is my go-to flour combination. It\u2019s a great balance to the dense, nutty buckwheat flour. The sautéed apples and pecans and maple syrup make this perfectly, essentially fall.

VI realized over the weekend how excited I am about salads for this time of year. Salad in the colder months of fall and winter is a different beast than a bright, refreshing plate of summer produce tossed in olive oil. They\u2019re big and bold; they have heft and weight and substance. And I think that I almost prefer it that way. Perhaps because there\u2019s a challenge in creating an appealing salad that fits with the mood and the tone of the season. In summer, salad is easy and expected, whereas in fall and winter the produce is dense, rooty, starchy, the merit of the vegetables a little less straightforward. They require a little coaxing. I love it.  On Saturday I visited  New Family Farm  in Sebastopol with 18 Reasons. My ever-present pastoral Sebastopol fantasies notwithstanding, the visit was inspiring. It\u2019s easy to cast a rose-colored patina over farm life, but I doubt anybody would call the work itself easy. I appreciated how open they were in discussing the challenges of beginning and sustaining and learning about the business of farming. And I appreciated their idealism. We need idealistic people in the world to keep fighting, uphill, that good fight. Like growing vegetables that we can believe in.  18 Reasons fed us a gorgeous lunch with produce from the farm \u2013 roasted delicata squash and roasted kale and quinoa dressed with oregano and chile. And that\u2019s exactly what inspired this salad. I had Thanksgiving in mind with the big flavors going on here: smoky chills, paprika, fresh lime, toasted nuts, sweet cranberries, sweet-spicy squash, nutty quinoa and earthy kale to pull it all together. I had a hard time giving this salad a name that captured its bigness. And so, a big and beautiful harvest salad for the colder months.

V(Such timing, this morning, while finishing this post: SAVEUR announced their 2013  Best Food Blog Awards  finalists, and I am utterly thrilled, humbled and overjoyed that The Year in Food is among those nominated. I\u2019d be so honored if you took a moment to cast a vote for this site! xo, Kimberley)  When I was a kid, my sister and I frequented a little stream in the woods about a quarter mile from our house. We snuck along the side of a neighbor\u2019s house, through overgrown thickets of blackberry brambles and along a long-neglected utility road to a tall, shady stand of trees and fallen logs and big boulders. Miner\u2019s lettuce is a shade-loving plant and it was everywhere. The name is so evocative, and its relationship to California\u2019s Gold Rush history, even if exaggerated, made me feel like I could be a totally self-sufficient forest dweller if need be. We would catch newts and pretend to grill them. (Apparently, they\u2019re poisonous. Good thing we never actually ate them. And so much for self-sufficiency.) We had a series of plywood planks and old wood boards criss-crossing a huge grove of hollowed out redwoods: that was where we would live, in our forest dweller fantasy. I\u2019m so happy that I got a little bit of a carefree childhood like that, that I could wander into the woods and play with my sister and fall off rocks and make a big mess in a stream and survive all of it. Because I think most of us survived those less-tethered, occasionally unsupervised childhoods. And our unsupervised adventures to the stream are among my absolute favorite memories. This year on Easter Sunday, I went on a rainy day photo walk with some friends in the Presidio. It was nice to be out earlyish, and on such a quiet morning, and with such dramatic weather. I love spring storms and glorious grey light. It makes me happy. Also making me happy: that I discovered a huge grove of miner\u2019s lettuce in the urbane wilds of the Presidio. It brought me right back to those days of childhood survivalist fantasies.  It\u2019s among the most easily identifiable of plants to forage, owing to its unique round lettuce leaf with the little white flower in the middle. The flavor is mild, sort of spinach-y, with a pleasant sturdiness to the leaf despite its delicate appearance. Just make sure you positively identify it before munching on them!  Love this article by the ever-wise-about-foraging Hank Shaw:  Foraging for Miner\u2019s Lettuce

VMy birthday happened at the beginning of the month. I hosted a big seafood feast. I wanted a bunch of my favorite people together at a table and a ton of seafood \u2013 Dungeness crab, oysters, a big stew with mussels and clams and fish, etc. As these things go, I had an overly grand vision whose execution kinda knocked the wind out of me. Sunday arrived, people began to show up, and for as much time as I had spent prepping dishes in advance, most of it remained uncooked. So the kitchen is where most of the party happened. Everyone offered to help, and it was a happy chaos of chopping and maneuvering and questions and multitasking and champagne-drinking and oyster-shucking and stew-making. This seems to be how parties go when I host them. I construct laughably ambitious plans. I do not pull them off before people show up. We end up in the kitchen.  This dip was supposed to be an appetizer at the party. The beets had already been roasted. But they were hiding out in the fridge and amidst the commotion in the kitchen, I completely forgot about it. So it goes. This was inspired by a dish that I had at  Linger  in Denver while hangin\u2019 with  Kelsey . They garnished theirs with dill and pistachios and feta and I followed their lead. I love how bold the magenta color is, and how quiet the beet flavor is in the end result. I\u2019m all about exploiting beets for their color. And it\u2019s amazing what just a half teaspoon of smoked paprika will do to a dish. It felt like something was missing until I added it. If you don\u2019t have smoked paprika, this would be a wise moment to invest in some. Makes a world of difference.

VThere\u2019s a hike that I try to get to once a week. Nestled in the dramatic, golden Marin headlands, it starts above the Pacific coast just south of Stinson Beach, and makes its way determinedly up the mountain into Mt. Tamalpais State Park. Most of the time, it is the same tangle of trails that I fall into, instinctively. For a while I felt like I  ought   to explore new trails, step outside my familiar routine, understand the nuances of the park a little more deeply. Then I started to really appreciate going to the same place weekly. There are so many little details that are different, especially if I miss a week or two: the angle of the sun through the dark canopy of trees that I pass under as I make my way into the woods; which flowers are blooming, or not; the colors and textures of the forest floor; the hues of the grassy hills; which animals I might see or hear. (At dusk, I hear owls, other times, frogs, and often, seasonal cycles of birdsong; I\u2019ve seen a young deer leaping out of the canopy; and once, a small, surprised bobcat.) And something else happens: because I don\u2019t have to worry about  where  I\u2019m going, I just get to be there. The mind relaxes differently when it\u2019s not thinking about the how. Some weeks I go up there with so much angst from my life that I am not very much there at all. Others, I\u2019m so deeply immersed in the shady cocoon of woods that I am caught off guard as dusk falls. Always, I leave feeling so much more like the me that I want to be.  Lately I\u2019ve been fiercely grabbing on to these rituals, those familiar, everyday acts that fill the pockets of our days. Walking through my neighborhood in the evenings, often along the same few roads, or making that same, satisfying preparation of my favorite vegetables, week after week. I think some of it is because so much of my life \u2013 especially my work life \u2013 is about the new and the unfamiliar, so much of it is me in at the deep end, that I need the anchoring that comes with familiar habits.  Oatmeal falls very much into this camp for me: it\u2019s comfortingly familiar and it is very much a ritual of the morning. It\u2019s one of perhaps three breakfasts in rotation most mornings of the year. To all the naysayers out there, give this a try. It\u2019s got the texture and the sweet/salty balance that is sometimes lacking in this most everyday of breakfasts, and the nuttiness and toothsome qualities of steel-cut oats really redeems it. I like to mix it up a little, depending on what fruit\u2019s in season, and vacillating between the ease of quick-cooking oats and the deeper satisfaction of steel-cut. I love what  Megan  has done with the initial toasting of the oats in butter; it\u2019s kinda genius and the simplest little step for the depth of flavor that it adds. Make a big batch at the beginning of the week and keep it in the fridge. And add nuts, fruit, cinnamon and cardamom generously, and maple syrup and even some toasted coconut flakes. These details make it feel both like you\u2019re taking care of yourself and treating yourself. It\u2019s a perfect ritual.  I\u2019ve been so excited for this gem of a book to be released. Now that it\u2019s here, I\u2019m smitten. Breakfast is such a rich subject, and Megan\u2019s aced it. Steel-cut oats, I learned long ago, benefit from a little salt to bolster the sweet \u2013 don\u2019t be shy here. Do whatever you like with them to finish, but give this method a whirl to start. The toasting of the oats is an awesome first step.

VI\u2019m making my way to Montana, my power state, my spirit animal, my  place . I have always wanted to go there in the winter, to experience it outside of its easy summer glory. This year Montana is my valentine. I will bundle up, go snowshoeing, and bear witness to its winter splendor.  I made some muffins for the road. I wanted something with fresh fruit involved so it didn\u2019t feel too cake-y, something befitting winter, something with a note of chocolate, and a nod towards the wholesome. I love what the right balance of buckwheat does in a baked good. Here it feels like winter incarnate: they\u2019re dark, and just sweet enough, with a hint of bitterness and crunch from the cacao nibs, and they\u2019re earthy and rich and fragrant with spices. Share them with everyone you love.

VI love this time of year. There\u2019s something kind of sparklingly magical about it. The crackly edge in the air, the threat of those long winter nights as the evenings lose their light earlier. It\u2019s brisk. A little  wild . But then it\u2019s tempered by blithe, warm days when it feels like all is right in the world. And I think this in-between place that flirts with both summer and winter is reflected equally in the produce available now.  There are the last of the plums and tomatoes crashing up against delicata and butternut and hubbard squash. There are all manner of peppers on the scene still; apples seem to be peaking already, and pears are close on their tails. And pomegranates, what? I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve ever seen pomegranates arrive so early. So it goes.  Anyhow, it\u2019s a rare moment. We get the best of both. I had some grand visions for this salad. There were going to be figs, too, and pomegranate, and more nuts and seeds \u2013 kind of in homage to the volume of things available right now. This grand harvest season. But I toned it down. Point is, let this in-between be an opportunity to mix it up. Apples and peppers, why not? Or pears and plums and pluots. Or figs and tomatoes. It\u2019s a rare window we\u2019ve got right now.

VThere was a point towards the end of my book-making process when  Stacy  remarked that one of the recipes we were working on didn\u2019t really seem very much like me. I was slightly bummed to hear that. But she was absolutely right. Here\u2019s the thing: taking on a project of such scale made me stupidly anxious. I believed that I had to make the most original, biggest and best of everything for this book to be the kind of cookbook that has weight in the world. Towards the end there, I kind of forgot one of the things that had drawn me to home cooking in the first place: its simplicity.  This is not to say that I don\u2019t love every single recipe that I made for my cookbook. I do. Even those few that are a little more fussy. But there\u2019s a lesson here, about following my own north star and being faithful to what\u2019s essentially me. The seriousness of taking on a book caused me to lose sight of that a little bit.  To be fair, there\u2019s also this creative itch that I have, and brainstorming creative recipe ideas scratches that itch. It\u2019s one of my favorite things to do on long walks: think about flavors and ingredients and how they might pair together. But there\u2019s also this special magical place where creative flavors pair together in a really accessible way. And that\u2019s what I want to hang on to. At the end of the day, the book is a labor of love and an experiment. I think that I had to cross that threshold \u2013 venturing into complicated cooking territory \u2013 to be reminded how much I love simplicity in food, to be reminded that not every recipe I produce must be the most wildly creative recipe ever. Having spent time away from cooking since submitting my manuscript, I\u2019m glad to be reminded of the power of a simple dish. I believe that this lies at the heart of home cooking. Most nights, my vegetables are sautéed and tossed with salt and pepper. And that\u2019s enough.  (P.S.: Save the squash seeds and  roast them. It\u2019s a testament to the quiet beauty of this book that my dad wound up buying two copies: one for me, and one for my stepmom, because she loved my copy so much. This recipe epitomizes simplicity. Nancy Singleton Hachisu has a deep love for and understanding of Japanese home cooking; the book is a gem. I\u2019m a huge fan of the intense umami flavors of miso. You can buy a small quantity of it in bulk at a natural foods store if you\u2019re not ready to commit to a whole tub of miso. But if you are ready to commit to a whole tub of it, adding a tablespoon of the paste to a bowl of hot water and throwing in some veggies and protein makes for the easiest soup ever. And guess what? You don\u2019t need to peel kabocha squash. Hallelujah.

VAll winter I have been dreaming of winter. I know: most of you are ready for it to be done. You\u2019ve had snowmageddons and polar vortices and ice storms and all kinds of ridiculous, frigid, challenging weather. In California, there\u2019s been hardly any winter to speak of, owing to a different kind of ridiculous: our crazy,  record-breaking drought . It\u2019s been weird: record strings of dry, warm days that make typically cool and foggy San Francisco feel almost like the perennially warm Los Angeles. Many fruit trees need a dormant period of cold to bear fruit the next summer. Perhaps I am the same. A sense of the seasons makes the passing of time feel right.  That\u2019s part of why I went to Montana: I ached to feel a deep sense of winter in my bones. And I got it in spades. It snowed every day. It was cold, and windy, and snowy, and invigorating. I snowshoed, cross-country skied, explored the snow-packed roads with big winter boots on, took my camera everywhere, witnessed a lot of magnificent wildlife, experimented with gluten-free sourdough (more on that soon!!!), and was really, really happy to have brought this soup along with me, where its flavor increased exponentially with the plummeting temperature. The cold and the challenges of winter bring the little luxuries of our lives into such sharp focus. I like to be reminded of these things.  There\u2019s something lovely in having a period of time dedicated to rest, even if our culture hardly allows for it. I think that\u2019s where winter becomes frustrating: when we have to function at the same level against circumstances that ask us to stay put and to pause. Soups are, I think, a celebration  of slowing down, resting, and hibernation. A few weeks back I had a version of this at one of my favorite restaurants,  Nopalito , and I was smitten. What I\u2019m most blown away by is the simplicity and richness of the broth: it\u2019s just vegetable or chicken stock in which dried chipotle chiles are soaked, and a can of fire-roasted tomatoes is added for good measure. Caldo Tlalpeño typically has carrots, chickpeas, and green beans, along with chicken and avocado to finish. Nopalito smartly added winter crucifers: cauliflower and brussels sprouts. I followed their lead with an abundance of leafy winter vegetables: magenta-hued orach (a wild spinach cousin), baby rainbow chard leaves, and baby rainbow carrots. Way to bring the color in winter.  This soup is a little bit of a mash-up between caldo tlalpeno and sopa de tortilla. (Caldo Tlalpeno doesn\u2019t traditionally have tortilla strips.) It does typically have chicken, but I made this version vegetarian. The framework is so forgiving. This is definitely a kitchen sink kinda soup: throw in the last of whatever\u2019s in the crisper drawer. It\u2019ll likely all taste good in there.

VIn a large stock pot, melt a little butter or olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the leeks and sauté, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for another minute or so. Add the vegetable broth, chipotle chiles, tomatoes, and epazote. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, add the carrots and chickpeas, and cook at a simmer until the carrots are cooked through. Add the leafy greens in the last couple minutes of cooking and turn off heat when the greens are soft. Set aside. \u000a

VAt the beginning of this year, I made a list of things that I wanted to prioritize in 2013. I didn\u2019t regard it as a set of resolutions, a set of  must-dos ; I just wanted these things to guide my year, to set a tone.  Among those was a pretty strong desire to have more collaborative relationships in my work and creative life. Navigating this new freelance world over the last two and a half years, and working mostly alone and mostly from home, has been terribly isolating sometimes. I\u2019m a person who deeply values alone time, but I have discovered the limits of my desire to be alone. It was making me kinda crazy. We are social creatures, and we need our people in life. That desire was crystal clear at the start of this year.  When I reached out to  Stacy  to see if she would like to help me in working on my cookbook, I was kind of in a desperate place: feeling overwhelmed, needing  help.  I didn\u2019t approach it as a collaboration. But that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s become. She comes to the table with her own expertise and wisdom, and is organized in a way that I may never be, and we get along marvelously. We share a similar philosophy around food, and her baking skills and attention to detail enrich the work that I make. It has been the most rewarding relationship in my book-making process. And I love that it\u2019s grown into one of the things that I wanted most this year: a collaboration.  A couple weeks ago, I visited  Blossom Bluff Orchards  in the central valley. Bryce kindly showed me around the acreage, taught me a little bit about the value of weeds in an organic orchard, and I left with a bag of some of the most delicious stone fruit I have ever set my teeth into. Among them, a life-changing white peach. Undoubtedly these are the best white peaches I have ever tasted. (I was not the biggest fan of white peaches prior to tasting these.) Working last week, we arrived at that point in the day when our appetites could no longer be neglected. Stacy and I pulled together a salad with what was on hand. She sautéed asparagus with lemon juice and garlic, a touch that I would not have considered, but one that deepened the flavors of the salad. She toasted almonds; I have gotten lazy about that and generally just throw them in raw. I love all the nuances in how we prepare food just a little bit differently, despite having so many affinities for the same things. And we tossed in those peaches from Blossom Bluff. And so a collaborative salad is born.  I am totally with Sarah of  The Yellow House  in the value of growing greens for easy salads nearly every day of the week. It\u2019s among the most simple and rewarding of things to grow. Maybe six weeks ago I planted some seedlings: arugula, red and green lettuces, kales. They are bursting now, and make having a bed of greens to begin a meal almost mandatory. I love that. And I love the simple reward of gardening. So go make a salad, and enjoy this tiny window of time when we can celebrate both the best of spring\u2019s late produce and summer\u2019s earliest glory.  And PS: I am deep, deep, deep in book-land now. Eating, breathing, sleeping book \u2013 literally. It\u2019s hard to come up for air. There might not be too much here over the next several weeks. But I\u2019ll be back when it\u2019s all done. xoxo

VFlying into New Orleans on a Friday afternoon, what struck me from the window of the airplane was how pervasive and dramatic the serpentine waterways were. It was a landscape of water upon water, broken just barely by clumps of small brownish dots \u2013 the water-loving plants of the bayou. It was, of course, the fluid, overlapping topography of the Missisissippi river, the gulf coast, and the bayou. Louisiana, it seems, is defined by water.  And Louisiana has an unbelievably powerful sense of place. It was intense, triggering all the senses (the colors! the smell of the bayou and the river and the humid air, the foods, the music and the birdsong and the straggly kitties and everyone, everywhere saying  hi ), and it was present everywhere: in the gorgeous, slightly dilapidated, colorful shotgun houses that characterize the neighborhoods of New Orleans, in the cooking, in the regional accent, in the music. It\u2019s a vibrant, wonderfully warm, amazing place, and I\u2019ve never been anywhere like it.  Here\u2019s my experience on Avery Island, the homeplace of the McIlhenny family and Tabasco sauce, mostly in photos: In the greenhouse learning about Tabasco peppers! Talking about the Tabasco mash in its early and later stages. We tasted the mash \u2013 the concentrated pepper and salt blend before vinegar is added. It\u2019s as intense as you would imagine!  The mash is aged for 3 years in old whiskey barrels that are re-used for decades! I am so inspired by the unique topography and color palette of the swampy bayous. It\u2019s gorgeous, and rich, and fecund, and a little spooky. And yeah, there are totally critters hiding out in there. Chef Brian Landry did an awesome demo on his Spanish and Creole-inspired cooking, before executing the MOST EPIC MEAL ever for us that evening. Before our epic feast, I snuck out for a stroll along the empty roads of Avery Island. I wanted to get deep in that landscape and have a moment with the bayou. I made my way down a dusty dirt road to a small dock. Stepping onto the dock I heard a loud commotion \u2013 I had surprised a giant water snake who slithered in a hurry back into the murky creek! Yikes. Sometimes my curiosity gets the best of me.  Also, I am completely obsessed with Spanish moss. I learned that it\u2019s an air plant \u2013 does that mean I can grow it at home? (Somebody send me some?)  The next day was equally epic. After an intense morning in the capsaicin-heavy air of the rooms where the mash is produced, we sped through the surrounding waterways to an old shack in the middle of nowhere. We were greeted by these awesome guys, who were totally busting out the zydeco jams.  We went on an air boat ride through the marshy bayou. It was gorgeous and grey and empty out there \u2013 and the boat was so fast and loud and awesome. I felt like I had been on a roller coaster after. Look at our badass captain! Then we feasted on the best crawfish boil ever, and some of us got down with the band. What an amazing trip. So much great food, an awesome group of bloggers, a really rare opportunity to understand the story of an impressive family-run business, and a whole heck of a lot of inspiration. I\u2019m still processing it. I feel so lucky to have been invited to join!  I knew that if I wanted to draw on the cornerstones of Cajun flavors for these guys that I had to step outside of my comfort zone a little bit. ( Red bell peppers out of season, heaven forbid! ) But the Cajun  holy trinity  \u2013 celery, bell pepper, and onion \u2013 felt like a necessary component to bring these to life. And it did. I very loosely adapted a basic Cajun seasoning to give these the big flavors that I was looking for, and rounded it out with Tabasco\u2019s smoky Chipotle Pepper Sauce, because I love a smoky element with the flavors of sweet potato. I am so stoked on how they turned out. Since these patties are a little bit delicate, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d work too well on a grill, unfortunately. Get that skillet super hot to give them a nice, blackened crust. It\u2019ll help them hold together. Smother them with all of your favorite condiments, squish em inside a bun, and have at it.

V(First, some great good news: I\u2019m a finalist in  Saveur\u2019s Best Food Blog Awards ! If you wouldn\u2019t mind taking a  moment to vote , I\u2019d be so honored. Voting closes next Wednesday, April 9th. Thank you!) When I was in school, I had a really hard time with critiques. It\u2019s kind of a cornerstone of the art school experience and it loomed large in my mental landscape. There\u2019s a lot of mythology around the value of critiques: how they prepare you to be able to speak about your work, how they throw you in at the deep end so that you learn to survive later, in that less kind  real world , how you learn to grow a thick skin and receive criticism with a modicum of grace. None of that was true for me. I was way, way too sensitive, and it took me three years to learn how to speak about my work, and I did not learn how to effectively field criticism. Nor did I find that feedback outside of school was less kind. Instead it has been more kind.  This isn\u2019t to say that I don\u2019t see the value in a thoughtful critique or in receiving challenging feedback. It was just the context of the program I was in: often there wasn\u2019t a lot of thought about the delivery and the remarks were guided by the first person to offer feedback; it would set a negative or a positive tone. What I have learned since is that we can choose to see the good in something, or we can choose to see the bad.  There\u2019s no accounting for taste , as they say. To see the good or the bad in any kind of creative work is a choice.  My last semester there, I decided to kind of own my critique. I loved the work that I had made so much, and I really fucking believed in it. So I went into that final critique and just made it a positive experience. My own enthusiasm was reflected in the feedback \u2013 I could see how that confidence quietly persuaded people out of a knee-jerk default towards negativity to one of curiosity and positivity and interest. It was a really powerful experience.  I\u2019m thinking about all of this lately because I\u2019m starting to ramp up the planning for my  book tour . (!!!) And those critiques are really my only point of reference for standing in front of people and talking about my work. I had a period of panic \u2013 the shy, introverted part of me nearly convinced me to just not do a tour, not step outside of my comfort zone, not stand in front of a group of strangers stricken with panic and forgetting how to speak.   But I realized that there\u2019s a striking difference: these events in support of my book aren\u2019t about finding the faults in the work. They\u2019re about celebrating a shared passion for cooking, and vegetables, and color, and farmers markets, and seasonality. They\u2019re about community; this is where I get to emerge from the intensely private place where that book was made, and connect with y\u2019all, face to face. And I\u2019m really excited about that. It feels like the reward for the work that has been done. I\u2019ll probably still be nervous, and I still have no idea what to talk about, but I\u2019m figuring that out.  For a long time I was trying to work out a creative take on tabbouleh, one that used quinoa instead of bulgur and was flexible with the veggies and the herbs. But what I kept making fell flat. When I pulled this together last week, I had envisioned it as more of a grain salad than anything else. But tasting it, I realized that this was the tabbouleh that I was after. It stretches the definition of tabbouleh, sure, but it hangs on to its core elements: the generous parsley, the bright lemon tang, the grain that holds it together, the brightness. I love what both Sara and Ashley have done with the harissa; it\u2019s a testament to the versatility of this bright, vivid sauce.

VSomewhere in junior high I took a class, something like  Home Ec , where we learned how to cook. I don\u2019t recall much except that the teacher was stern but kind, and imposed exacting rules around things like sifting flour (which I still don\u2019t usually do), scraping the bowls clean with a spatula (which I now sometimes do), and room temperature versus chilled ingredients. This kind of precision and specificity I associate with those who love to bake. I have learned that I am not really great at that kind of precision in the kitchen. I like to be a little loose when I cook. In the class, we learned how to make Dutch babies, something for which I have a lifelong fondness because it\u2019s my first memory of a really  successful  cooking project. There\u2019s a straightforward alchemy to it: you toss together a few ingredients and slide them into a warmed skillet. It goes into the oven and transforms into this wonderful, puffed up thing that deflates a little as it cools, but is warm and comforting and just delightful. And best of all, it\u2019s so simple. It doesn\u2019t demand the precision of other kinds of baked goods. What better way to turn a bunch of pre-teens on to the magic of cooking? She was a smart one, that stern but kind lady. Of course we would be wowed by Dutch babies.   Dutch babies have been on my to-make list for years, but when I stopped eating wheat, I figured that it was another baked good that was no longer an option. (I have wrongly abandoned so much, thinking that without wheat it was pointless. It\u2019s been awesome to rediscover so many foods.) This recipe is from  Green Kitchen Stories ; I\u2019ve been wanting to make it since they posted it last year. They call it a fat almond pancake, and I love that name. And while it\u2019s not exactly a Dutch baby, that\u2019s the memory it evokes, and the two are similar in spirit. It\u2019s reminiscent of a soufflé or bread pudding. As long as you don\u2019t expect a conventional pancake when you tuck into this soft, melting dish, you\u2019ll be pleased as punch.  Today is the last day to vote in  Saveur\u2019s Best Food Blog  awards, where the Year in Food is a  finalist  in the Best Cooking Blog Category! I\u2019d be so thrilled to have your vote. Thank you!!

VRunning a blog is kind of like owning a small business, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes I forget this. Until, oh, I make a decision to change the permissions on my Flickr images and every single link to every single photo on this site is broken. Oops. (And please excuse those broken image links as I work to get through them. Soon!) There is no repair person to call, no assistant in the next room to do the drudge work. I had to suck it up and  deal . It\u2019s been an inconvenience, but life is full of those, right? I\u2019ve been thinking a lot recently about how easily I get frustrated with situations. Somehow, this one didn\u2019t get the better of me. (No tears!) There  are  hours ahead of fixing to do, but I\u2019ve got my fingers, my toes, my health, my friends and my family. That\u2019s right.  Originally, I was going to open this post praising this dish for reinvigorating my taste for beets. I realized not too long ago that beets don\u2019t excite me the way some vegetables do \u2013 brussels sprouts and cauliflower, for instance. Some combination of their intense sweetness and earthy, mineral taste vaguely reminiscent of dirt leave something to be desired. I wanted to love them, though. And while this chimichurri was originally destined for  these cauliflower steaks , once I realized how perfect a foil they would be on beets, there was no turning back. Chimichurri is intense, vibrant and puckery, full of the bright flavors of olive oil, red wine vinegar, shallots and garlic, rounded out with the heat of a few chile flakes \u2013 all good things to temper the earthy, sweet flavors of a beet. This is one instance where a mandoline is extra, extra helpful. Mandatory, even. Since we\u2019re working with raw beets, slicing them paper-thin helps them marinate better in the chimichurri. (And don\u2019t eat too much \u2013 beets can cause tummy upset!)

VMontana has this habit of turning me inside out. Every year, it shakes me up, tosses me around, and gently leaves me at the side of the road, temporarily blinded, totally exhilarated, and questioning everything. I\u2019ve tried to deconstruct why it has this power over me, but sometimes overthinking gets you nowhere. My point is, I\u2019m still trying to make sense of this year\u2019s trip, and I\u2019m not there yet.  That this place has such a power over me speaks not only to the magnitude of the landscape but also to the value of taking a physical and mental break from the day-to-day. Out there, I have the luxury of being engaged by the present: the dramatic, craggy mountains, the deep, glacier-carved valleys, the turquoise-hued lakes, the over-the-top fields of wildflowers (and yes, we sang songs from  The Sound of Music , because those hills  are  alive); and the unparalleled experience of hiking through woods in which grizzly bears are hanging out. There is really nothing comparable to being in a place that reminds us that we\u2019re not top dog. The fact of the bears\u2019 presence colors so much of the experience of being in those mountains, and it\u2019s humbling, to say the least.  While I may not be mentally home, I am bodily back in my city, and this body is back to eating the kind of breezy, end-of-summer fare that I was all over prior to my departure. (Intense craving for juicy bison burgers notwithstanding!) So here\u2019s some breezy California eating at its finest: delicate halibut, a substantive marinade, and some crisp watermelon pickles and watercress to balance the spicy and the sweet. Bon appetit.

aVFill your canning jars with watermelon rind. (A single quart jar or smaller pint jars will work great.) Pour the hot brine over the watermelon. Let sit until the brine has cooled, then refrigerate. These pickles need to sit at least overnight to develop, but giving them a couple of days is even better. \u000a

VA couple weeks ago, I took a rather impromptu trip out to Yellowstone. Work had slowed and after a crazy December it was nice to head out and clear my mind. It\u2019s an incredible landscape, and it\u2019s made even more dramatic by a blindingly bright blanket of snow and clusters of bison dotting the vast Lamar valley. Yellowstone is fascinating in the winter. It is desolate, nearly empty, so you have the bubbling, steaming thermal features and all kinds of wild animals almost to yourself. It is quiet. We spotted coyotes, a red fox, elk, eagles and wolves \u2013 but the wolves were only visible at a great, great distance through powerful spotting scopes. There\u2019s a group of dedicated wolf-obsessed folks who\u2019ll spend an entire day criss-crossing Lamar valley \u2013 a place the wolves frequent for an abundance of prey \u2013 in search of various packs. It\u2019s almost as fascinating to watch them in their single-minded obsession, as they chat with each other on walkie talkies, referencing landmarks and packs in a coded language, as it is to watch the wolves.  Lovely Cooke City from the bus It never gets so cold in our mild San Francisco. So it was nice to be reminded what real, bone-shattering temperatures feel like. The power of that cold to get into every last unprotected nook was pretty profound. And it made eating hot foods gratifying on a level that\u2019s hard for me to understand when it\u2019s 50 degrees out. I rode on a day-long snowcoach tour \u2013 there were only two of us aside from the driver \u2013 and we stopped for lunch in remote Cooke City, Mt, for some bowls of hot chili. The spiciness and heat were invigorating. Since then, besides fantasizing about a dual life in Montana, I\u2019ve been obsessed with foods that are deeply, fundamentally warming. The best of those, by far, are stews. Let\u2019s call this fried rice a close second. Fried rice was a favorite of mine as a kid. I had forgotten about that until I tried it again (and fell in love with it again) at  Mission Chinese Food . Their iteration, greasy and hot and salty and wonderful, is a little bolder than what many of us grew up eating, but totally and completely satisfying on that same, starchy level. And this version is tamer on both the greasy and bold fronts, but again, equally satisfying. What are your favorite cold-weather foods?

VI thought that I had generated an awesome original concept with this bay leaf butter. But no, of course I am not the first person ever in the history of home cooking to consider adding herbs to butter. And yeah,  David Chang totally beat me to it . A lot of these ideas come to me on long walks \u2013 moments where I am away from the internet and can believe, temporarily, that I am a clever and innovative person, reinventing the food wheel, as it were.  This got me thinking about that old chestnut so often repeated while I was in art school, about there being nothing original. Innovation mattered a lot in the context of art and design, not only to me but to many of my peers. We were all aggressively in pursuit of the original, the unconventional, the groundbreaking. While there is a lot to be said for pushing ourselves to the edge of the familiar, it can also be a burden. With home cooking, most of the time I don\u2019t care about being wildly groundbreaking \u2013 and that\u2019s a relief. But one of the things that I love most about cooking is brainstorming creative ingredient pairings, and occasionally littler innovations emerge. The real beauty of this roast bird is in the simplicity of its ingredients. The vibrant flavors of the bay leaves and the preserved lemons invigorate the roast and bring new life to this cozy weeknight staple of fall and winter tables. You can easily prepare this with a regular chicken, too \u2013 just adjust the cooking time accordingly.

VHere in San Francisco we\u2019re approaching the time of year when we\u2019re fogged in, windy and cloudy while the rest of the northern hemisphere frolics half-naked in ridiculous heat.

Which is why I made this cornbread. Cornbread\u2019s great any time of year, no doubt. But isn\u2019t there something kind of classically summery and celebratory about it? And when you stud cornbread with a pile of fresh, perfect blueberries and bake it in a cozy oven in a cast-iron skillet, the shortcomings of the season are mitigated, just a little. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for right now.  This Blueberry Cornbread recipe is part of  The May Seasonal Food Guide.

VThis cocktail epitomizes spring. It is intensely, deeply pink, buoyed by fennel-infused gin and a vivid rhubarb syrup. Finished with a vigorous shake, it is light, just sweet enough, and bordering on dangerous for all its demure qualities. Fresh rhubarb is absolutely critical here \u2013 during a rhubarb shortage in April, I made this with frozen rhubarb and the flavor left something to be desired.  Enjoy it on the roof or lounging around in a grassy backyard somewhere warm, watching clouds roll by, and listening to music that makes you nostalgic and happy all at once. Something like  The Boys of Summer Note: For those of you not fond of the flavor of fennel, it\u2019s pretty mild in this drink. You could also try swapping out the fennel for ginger or orange.

aVFresh rhubarb is absolutely critical here \u2013 during a rhubarb shortage in April, I made this with frozen rhubarb and the flavor left something to be desired.

VI love December. Every year, without trying, I get stupidly excited about Christmas \u2013 and go at it with the enthusiasm of a six year old who\u2019s acquired a few domestic skills along the way. But with that, though, comes the stress of the season, which gives everything sparkly about this month a run for its money. I am busier than ever this year but I don\u2019t want to let holiday stress cast a dark pall over these next couple weeks, so I spent some time really considering what I need to keep myself from turning into a scrooge. I made a list and I will be checking it twice. A list of things that make me happy, that inspire me, that calm me down. We all need one of these. Here\u2019s a few of mine: evening walks,  podcasts , friends, nourishing + cozy food, hot mugs of tea, reading, getting away from the internet, getting enough sleep, going out to dinner, nerding out in front of the Christmas tree with sentimental movies. (I do that.) A lot of these things are obvious, right? It\u2019s hard, sometimes, to remember to do when we\u2019re so busy, but so important at this time of year \u2013 taking a moment for ourselves. This baked oatmeal is all about taking care, taking that moment. It\u2019s nourishing and healthy but hearty and cozy too. And, it\u2019s made a believer of me. Oatmeal\u2019s everydayness sometimes leaves something to be desired. Making it like this takes it to another level. I made it late at night for the following morning but think it\u2019s best immediately out of the oven. You get this wonderful, toothsome crust and a kind of buoyancy and heft to the oatmeal that\u2019s very much absent in its stovetop form. Hope your season\u2019s bright.

VWhite wine sangria is so quintessentially spring. No matter that it\u2019s been chilly and rainy here and downright frigid on the east coast. We need something to aspire to. And according to the weather forecast, my fair city\u2019s got a spell of 70 degree days coming our way. We need to be ready. And this is how we prepare.  And let\u2019s overlook the fact that this doesn\u2019t really resemble the, um, blood that sangria refers to, or that you can\u2019t even see the kumquats that are supposed to be the star of this refreshing drink. If kumquats are out of season by the time you have a go at this, substitute them with some other fruit. If it\u2019s summer, peaches and melons and grapes work marvelously. Oh, summer.

I wouldn\u2019t have believed the breathless comparisons to mashed potatoes \u2013 minus the junk that makes mashed potatoes guilt-ridden \u2013 had I not eaten them myself.

VThis is not your traditional Whiskey Smash. But that\u2019s okay. Smashes are typically strong, dangerously strong, and their strength is often masked by a surplus of sugar, and this just leads people down a dark road. We don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s summer, after all, right? Instead, this version showcases plums at their finest, tethered by the subtle, anisette taste of fresh tarragon, rounded out with lime juice and just enough sugar, and lightened with a splash of sparkling water to keep a single round from making you do embarrassing, regrettable things.  And in case you were in need of some beautiful, inspiring things to pair with this summery cocktail, might I suggest:  The brand-new, gorgeously curated  Kinfolk Magazine , launched today.  The super clever, totally original  Turntable Kitchen Pairings Box.  You get an original 7\u2033 record each month, plus food, recipes and ideas to compliment. So rad. Happy Friday, all. Chin chin!

Turn it as each side begins to blacken and blister until most of the surface has charred. Set aside to cool. Once cool, remove the skin under running water. Lastly, dice the pepper and set aside.\u000a
p3459
aVDo the same with your ear of corn. Unlike the poblano, though, you don\u2019t want to char it until it\u2019s entirely black, just nicely browned. When the corn is cool enough to work with, stand it vertically and slice the kernels from the cob using a sharp knife.\u000a
p3460
aVIn a mixing bowl, combine the feta and goat cheese with the diced poblano, corn and basil. Add salt and pepper to taste. \u000a
p3461
aVBegin to heat your oil for frying a small or medium sized saucepan. Use a candy thermometer for accuracy. You want to fry these at 350 degrees. \u000a

aVPrepare the tempura batter: Add the flour to a mixing bowl, and stir in the sparkling water, stirring until just combined. A lumpy batter is perfect. Set aside until blossoms are ready.\u000a
p3463
aVPrepare the squash blossoms: remove the inner stamen by carefully inserting a finger and plucking it loose. It should come loose pretty easily, and if the blossom tears a little, it\u2019s not the end of the world. \u000a
p3464
aVOnce the stamens have been removed, measure one tablespoon of the filling and carefully stuff it into each squash blossom. Twist the top of the blossom to keep it closed.\u000a

VA couple months back, Gilt Taste invited a handful of food bloggers to review and cook with products from their site and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to participate. Last week I received a box of gorgeous, perfect produce from  Farmer Jones Farm  \u2013 Gilt Taste\u2019s  Chef\u2019s Tasting Box. Filled with the most charming carrots, tiny potatoes, micro-greens, edible flowers, fresh herbs, beets and tender, uncured garlic, it was such a fun and creative challenge to consider how to develop the ingredients into a handsome recipe. Doing this brought me back to the creative place that fueled the Seasonal Food Guides \u2013 a process of thinking and considering, of addition and subtraction, of strategizing and speculation.  What I landed on was this salad. I\u2019m enamored with the flavors of Thai cooking right now and had originally considered a more straightforward curry \u2013 something whose heat and coziness would be perfect this time of year. But the produce was in such perfect form by itself that I didn\u2019t want to mess with it too much. I considered translating the flavors of a curry into a dressing \u2013 hanging on to the coconut milk (a great starting point for a dressing), the curry paste, the lime, cilantro, mint and green onion and putting it to work with the carrots, microgreens and a little quinoa for heft. And here we are. It is indeed spicy \u2013 so those with a sensitive palate might want to hold back on the red chile flakes.

VGuys, I almost failed you this month. Recklessly disregarding all that fancy language about fleeting spring produce, I nearly arrived at the end of the month without any fava greens, the foundation for this salad. It took six fruitless visits to various markets both east and west of the bay, with mounting despair, before landing on my saving grace:  Hayes Valley Farm.  I remembered that there was a proliferation of fava plants all over their property and I crossed my fingers and wished really hard for a little miracle. Hallelujah and praise be. They delivered.  While fava beans are still sprouting up across farms big and small throughout the country (they enrich the soil with nitrogen, which is great for crops), it seems that their run in Bay Area markets may be nearing an end. You can always ask politely at a local farm, or even better, plant some of your own. It\u2019s a fabulous, toothy green with a subtle fava bean flavor that\u2019s great to have on hand if you\u2019d like to liven up your weeknight salad. Happy almost summer!

VSometimes it is challenging to enjoy a salad in the coldest parts of the winter. But we need our roughage, no matter the frigidity outside, and this one is pretty amazing for its simplicity. It\u2019s pleasantly evocative of any number of other classic salads \u2013 cole slaw, the iceberg wedge or a Waldorf \u2013 without being quite like any of them.  It is, I am convinced, the combination of the caraway seeds and the crunch of the cabbage that makes this work so well. The brightness and zing of the dressing keep it lively and different from your typical weeknight green salad with vinaigrette.

So bad for you that you\u2019ll eat two servings without batting an eye. We\u2019ve got just under two months to make the most of outdoor activities.

VIf you can get someone else to do the dirty work for you (that is, the cleaning), squid is perhaps the simplest and least fussy seafood out there. And it requires only the briefest of cooking times \u2013 about 90 seconds to two minutes per side should do it. They taste like smoky, briny heaven coming off the grill, bathed in a simple marinade of garlic, olive oil and lemon juice, and tossed with cherry tomatoes, bitter greens and garbanzo beans.  This is the kind of salad that\u2019s made for summer. It\u2019s a cinch to prepare and it tastes better if you eat it outside. And it has all the protein you need for a light evening meal! Done and done.  This Grilled Squid Salad recipe is part of  The June Seasonal Food Guide.

VFirst, marinate the squid. In a mixing bowl, combine the squid with 2 tablespoons olive oil, half the lemon juice, the minced garlic, and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Set aside. You\u2019ll want them to sit for no more than a half hour in their marinating liquid, because the acid of the lemon juice will start to cook them. \u000a

p3768
aVWhen your grill is ready, place squid on the grill. You may use skewers if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s not necessary. Grill for about 2 minutes on each side. (If your grill is less hot, you may need to increase the time, just a little.)\u000a

VIt\u2019s the briefness of the season that makes produce like strawberries such a treat, and so easy to obsessively covet. And crisps are such a great vehicle for this spring berry.  These little mini crisps are perfect for when you don\u2019t want to commit to having 8 servings of dessert in the house, for small dinners with friends or family. And serving them in ramekins is adorable. (Thanks to  Sprouted Kitchen\u2019s Peach + Blackberry Crumble  for the inspiration on this one.) While baking, your house will smell like the most perfect slice of buttered strawberry toast. Eating it is like spooning jam from a jar, only better, because there is the nuanced depth provided by Balsamic vinegar, the kick of black pepper and that lovely, classic crisp crust, where the almonds and the oats add texture and tooth.

VLast week I wondered what it would take for me to get my mind off food, to give myself a little respite, enjoy a seasonal movie or something, anything, unrelated to food. The answer came quickly, in the form of a nasty foodborne illness that wiped out my dad, stepmom and I in quick succession. In the thick of it all, under the surreal weight of a high fever and wracked with nausea, I tried to read an article in the NYT about sweet potatoes. I couldn\u2019t. I got up for a weak cup of tea and was sent running by the smell of chicken soup. It was, thankfully, brief. And it got my mind off food.  When I recovered enough to eat, I only had an appetite for the most boring of consumables. And so I turned to this, which is a favorite go-to when feeling sick. It\u2019s a great tug-o-war between comfort food and health food, which is my arena, it seems. I\u2019ve omitted the heavy cream, replaced that with yogurt and soy milk (any kind of milk will work, but may I kindly advise you to shy away from dairy when sick? ); in lieu of all that lovely, nutrientless flavor, I add onion, garlic and herbs, so that you don\u2019t know you\u2019re missing anything at all, and top it with some spinach or kale to fortify it that extra bit. If your stomach is weak, though, as mine was, you may want to forgo the garlic and herbs altogether. If you\u2019re trying to shake a cold, however, I\u2019d recommend adding even more garlic. It\u2019s good for the immune system. Onion too.  Of course, you don\u2019t have to be sick to eat this. It\u2019s a cinch to make, and it\u2019s a forgiving recipe, and is good any old night, alongside a nice roast, or even as an accompaniment to soup. Pair it with a fried egg and you\u2019ve got a cozy weeknight dinner or perfect weekend breakfast.

VI like beginnings. I am ready to bid adieu to 2010 and say hello to 2011, with its sparkling clean slate and big possibilities.  And I also like cozy, quiet brunches and subdued January skies, and this little breakfast is perfect for that. Serving a complete breakfast in a single dish makes it feel like a little present, complete with tasty, unexpected morsels buried beneath creamy, just-cooked eggs. They are also remarkably easy to make, which is a good thing right about now.  Think of this recipe as a framework. You could omit the salmon, swap it out for some bacon or sausage, or forgo meat altogether. You could use any cheese you fancy. You could call on onions instead of leeks, or spinach instead of arugula.  Happy New Year everybody! Here\u2019s to a sparkling 2011.

VFirst, some exciting news: I\u2019m now going to be contributing creative seasonal recipes to Etsy\u2019s blog! I am absolutely thrilled about this. Etsy\u2019s dedication to community and craft is something that I have a huge amount of respect for. Go check out my first post,  Lamb Burgers with Peach Chutney. Let\u2019s talk about the weekend. Oh, the weekend! San Francisco was in top form over the holiday weekend, gracing us with a rare heat wave and the ability to actually participate in and enjoy every last classic detail of summer that should be enjoyed on a weekend such as this: back-to-back barbecues, evening walks in summer dresses, cool drinks, frozen desserts, watermelon, impromptu shade structures, lots of classic American rock, fireworks-viewing from rooftops, and a heck of a lot of meat. That\u2019s why this is a week dedicated to salad; it\u2019s time to recover from the indulgences of the weekend. We\u2019re in our prime where summer produce is concerned, and that means that one could make a different salad every night of the week and easily never repeat two ingredients. I can get behind that.  Here, every flavor serves an essential purpose: the fresh, tart and vibrant cherries play remarkably well off the spicy arugula, the marinated feta lends a heavenly, creamy softness, the wild rice provides texture and tooth, and the shallots and olive oil and Balsamic vinegar round out everything perfectly. Enjoy.  This Cherry, Arugula + Wild Rice Salad is part of  The June Seasonal Food Guide.

VIf, this weekend, you were looking for the perfect winter dish to spend a long afternoon preparing, one that will drive you mad with its luxuriously rich smells \u2013 red wine, butter, onions and bacon \u2013 this is your answer. Coq au Vin is the alpha and the omega of stews. There\u2019s really no two ways around that. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever had a stew as perfectly supple, deeply-bodied, or intrinsically wintry as this. Of course, you will have to work for your stew. There are a lot of steps. I have lately found myself preferring less fuss where the kitchen is concerned, and this is a little bit more fussy. But don\u2019t let that deter you, because it is undeniably worth it. The rewards are beyond compare. Sundays in January were made for making Coq au Vin.  I did not employ a coq in this Coq au Vin, but that is immaterial. I also did my best to reduce a couple of steps. Namely, I ditched the pearl onions. Pearl onions are fussy, and the only value they add to this is in the aesthetic. (And I could not find any frozen.) I also did not dredge the chicken in flour. I cut the butter by about half. I did not get slab bacon.  Also of note:  The Amateur Gourmet  has a really thorough, detailed visual breakdown of the process that is highly worth a visit. (Recipe linked below.)

V1. Place the bacon in a cold Dutch oven or similar large, heavy-bottomed pot. Cook over medium heat, turning as needed, for about ten minutes. You want it to be somewhat browned but retain some of the fat. Don\u2019t cook it to a crisp. Remove the bacon, chop roughly, and set aside. \u000a
p4070
aV2. Turn the heat up to medium-high. Give the pot a few minutes to heat more. Have your chicken ready to go. Make sure it\u2019s nice and dry, as this is what you will need in order to get that lovely brown crust when you sear it. \u000a
p4071
aV3. Place half the chicken (one each wing, thigh, drumstick, breast) in the pot and leave it alone for about five minutes. To get that crust, you don\u2019t want to jostle the meat at all. After about 5 minutes, flip each piece, and repeat. If it hasn\u2019t developed a really nice brown sear, leave the meat in for a little longer. \u000a
p4072
aV4. Take the first batch of chicken from the pot, and repeat step 3 with second half. \u000a
p4073
aV5. If you have a lot of excess fat in the pot, spoon the extra out, being careful not to remove any brown bits. \u000a
p4074
aV6. Reduce heat to medium, and add a tablespoon of butter. Add the onion and carrot, and saute, stirring some, for about five minutes. \u000a
p4075
aV7. Add the tomato paste and stir. Carefully add the cognac, deglazing the pot with it. Scrape all that yummy stuff from the bottom, and saute for another few minutes to reduce the liquid. \u000a
p4076
aV8. Raise the heat a little again, and add the bottle of wine, garlic, thyme, parsley and bay leaf, and bring to a boil.\u000a
p4077
aV    Simmer until liquid has reduced by half, about 15-20 minutes.\u000a
p4078
aV9. Add the bacon and the chicken stock and stir. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid for your second batch of onions.\u000a
p4079
aV10. Return the chicken to the pot. Amateur Gourmet suggested a certain order, but I didn\u2019t find that necessary.\u000a
p4080
aV11. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to very low on your stove, and simmer, undisturbed, for 45-60 minutes. You want the meat to be incredibly tender, but not quite falling off the bone. (Mine started to fall off the bone, no big deal.)\u000a
p4081
aV12. While your chicken is braising, prepare the garnish. Heat one tablespoon butter in a medium pan over a medium flame. Add the onions and saute for about 5 minutes.\u000a
p4082
aV13. Add the reserved braising liquid, season to taste with salt and pepper, and saute until most of the liquid has been reduced, about 10 minutes or so. Remove onions from heat and set aside.\u000a
p4083
aV14. Add another tablespoon of butter to the pan. Add the mushrooms and saute until the liquid has cooked off, another 10 minutes, roughly. Turn off heat, return onions to the pan, mix together and set aside. \u000a
p4084
aV15. Check on the chicken. If it\u2019s ready, turn off heat and skim any fat if necessary. Add the mushrooms and onions to the braise, stir.\u000a
p4085

VYesterday I went on my first ever chanterelle hunt. We made our way up into the Oakland hills on the kind of crisp,  wintry afternoon that seems so quintessentially northern Californian \u2013 all muted sunlight, hills soaked and green after so much rain, a chilly wind on the ridge, and a mess of clouds in the sky. There were, of course, no guarantees. We ambled for a mellow half hour or so through muddy horse trails and verdant meadows before heading into the shaded canopies of oak and redwood. You know, the dark and dank places where mushrooms like to grow. Not long in, beneath a tangle of spent blackberry brambles, my friend Evan spotted the first one. We snuck off the trail and into the dark of the redwoods, eyes trained firmly on the ground for another tiny burst of apricot. And there they were, those tiny bursts of apricot, and soon we had a pretty sizable collection of chanterelles.  Buoyed by this early stroke of luck, we kept darting off the trail anytime there was a hint of promise, but that was it. For all the muddy hillside-scrambling, crouched game-trail following, and misleading patches of pale gold tucked into every slope of damp leaf litter, we found no more chanterelles. Which is okay. We made out with something like two pounds each, just enough to cook down into a simple mess and pile atop a crusty slice of bread. Last year, I fell in love with  Fat of the Land\u2019s  lovely  Chanterelle and Fig Crostini . This year, I fell in love with  Seven Spoons\u2019  charming  Mushrooms on Toast . This recipe falls somewhere between the two.

aV Chanterelles absorb a lot of liquid, so it is best to wash them using as little water as possible. First, remove as much dirt as you can with your fingers or a paper towel, working gently. Then, under a delicate stream of water, remove any stubborn bits of forest floor. I found that I lost a fair amount of the mushroom surface in the cleaning, but would rather that than chew on grit. \u000a
p4143
aVFirst, as Evan had suggested I do, you\u2019ll want to sweat the chanterelles to reduce their liquid. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt half the butter. Place your thoroughly cleaned chanterelles in, give them a stir, and cover. When they\u2019ve sweat off most of their liquid, about 10-15 minutes, strain the mushrooms. Reserve the liquid for another use \u2013 you\u2019ve now got the beginnings for a great stock or secret flavor boost. Set the mushrooms aside.\u000a
p4144
aVToast your thin slices of bread now. Set aside.\u000a
p4145
aVIn the same pan, melt the other half of the butter. Add the shallots and saute, stirring regularly, for about 2-3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, thyme, dry Sherry and salt and pepper, and stir. Saute for another five minutes or so, until the Sherry has cooked off.\u000a

VI was reluctant to do anything with carrots. Reluctant because, here at the tail end of winter, we\u2019re kind of done with root vegetables, right? Yes. There\u2019s a longing for asparagus, strawberries and the excitement of spring produce, and they\u2019re almost here. But not quite. So what we do instead is jazz up those old root vegetables so it doesn\u2019t even matter what season it is.  And they work pretty darn fantastically in hummus. The roasted carrots add a delicate sweet note that is kept in check by the creamy goodness of the garbanzo beans, given nuance and depth by way of a generous helping of paprika and a little smoky heat from some ground chipotle. It\u2019s kind of addictive!  This Smoky Carrot Hummus recipe is part of the  March Seasonal Food Guide

VDo you ever linger at the stove after the vegetables have been roasted, oven door ajar and fingers splayed to enjoy that last blast of heat? It\u2019s been so cold lately that I have found myself huddling over the pan while making eggs in the morning, rewarming a cup of tea ten times throughout the day just to cuddle with it. For that reason I have found myself preferring anything that can be consumed in a bowl \u2013 you cannot really grip a plate and greedily savor its warmth. Originally I was going to call this dish Simple Winter Pasta. But there\u2019s a lot going on here, perhaps too much to warrant it being called simple. It\u2019s not complicated, however, and certainly won\u2019t require as much time or as many steps as last month\u2019s  Coq au Vin.  But there\u2019s a lot going on: the capers, anchovies and parmesan all play off each other in salty, briny, tangy goodness; the cauliflower and brussels sprouts are browned to caramelized perfection. The pasta acts as a simple vehicle, the parsley adds a little green, the chili some heat, and the lemon a touch of brightness. There you have it.

VSometimes I catch myself laughing out loud, privately, while listening to a particularly funny moment during  Wait Wait Don\u2019t Tell Me , one of my favorite radio shows. Carl Kassel\u2019s peerless narration, Peter Sagal\u2019s tasteless jokes and Mo Rocca\u2019s impromptu snark are like secret weapons on long walks through less than stellar neighborhoods in San Francisco. The show provides a buffer against all the unpleasant details of a rundown street, makes it a little easier to handle the fact that there are about 50,000 too many sad, club-footed pigeons and the only person who wants to take care of them is  Mike Tyson . It\u2019s sort of a triumph against the grime.  And while this salad may not make you laugh out loud, exactly, or protect you from the sight of deformed pigeons, it is also a triumph. It stands in bold defiance of winter while embracing some of its star fruits and vegetables. It is dense and nuanced with competing textures without being heavy. It is bright, crunchy, bitter, sweet and salty. The quinoa makes it heartier. And if you can find Cara Cara oranges, buy about a dozen of them. They are intensely, amazingly, profoundly sweet and the perfect foil to the sharpness of the radicchio.  (PS: Those adorable oil and vinegar cruets in the first image came from  pot + pantry , a fantastic new shop worth checking out.)

p4321
aVWhile the quinoa cooks, prepare the onions. Warm a medium skillet over a low flame. Add two teaspoons olive oil and the sliced onions. Keep covered, stirring occasionally. They should be about ready when the quinoa is. \u000a
p4322
aVNext, supreme the oranges. Using a sharp knife, slice the top and bottom from the orange, then slice the peel and the pith from the fruit. Holding the orange gently, slice vertically along the membrane to remove each section of orange. Set aside.\u000a
p4323
aVIn a large mixing bowl, combine the radicchio, fennel, feta, pumpkin seeds and parsley. Slowly mix in the quinoa \u2013 since it is warm it will soften things a little, which is okay. Slowly fold in the onions. Add the orange sections last. \u000a
p4324

VTalk of the rapturous qualities of pork, bacon in particular, and especially its animal power to sway vegetarians from the fold, makes me sort of ashamed that the thing that brought me out of vegetarianism was the pedestrian chicken. I understand, though, why people praise the pig, and why, time and again, it is preached as the gateway meat. The smell of it cooking, whether a roast, a braised shoulder, sausage or bacon, is such an animal thing \u2013 a profound assault of fat, protein, salt and spices sending the olfactory receptors into overload. So, when you decide to spend a weekend afternoon making carnitas, just know that you\u2019ve been warned, in advance, of its animal power. Your entire house will smell ridiculous. You will be hungry for hours, tempted perhaps to gnaw on a piece of wood to restrain your unquenchable hunger. Stay hungry, though. Carnitas are worth a huge appetite.  Tacos are, I believe, a great antidote to the dark days of winter. There\u2019s something in them that is optimistically spring-like, the bright colors of the vegetables and their crunch contrasting perfectly with the salty heaven that is slow-roasted pork.  This Carnitas recipe is part of the  February Seasonal Food Guide.

VMy very favorite hash comes from  Slow Club . Their take on the breakfast classic hits all the right notes: it\u2019s livened with ground turkey sausage, given a little sweetness by way of sweet potatoes and butternut squash, laced with piquant arugula, and topped with some sharp cheddar. I ate their hash nearly every weekend for a long stretch \u2013 they happen to be two blocks away. It\u2019s crazy, really, that it\u2019s taken me this long to give it a go myself.  What I\u2019ve done here isn\u2019t so much a faithful replica of theirs as it is a jumping off point. The sunchokes add a really interesting element to the mix, providing a subtle, sweet nuttiness that pairs especially well with the potatoes. I threw in some sweet potatoes for good measure, but went for spinach instead of arugula, and Parmesan in place of cheddar. Same same, but different. There\u2019s no meat in this version, but you could easily throw in some diced bacon and call it a day, happily.  This Root Vegetable Hash recipe is part of  The February Seasonal Food Guide.

aVOnce the onions are covered and can be left alone, bring a medium-sized pot of water to boil. This is for the poached eggs. Adjust the size of your pot depending on how many eggs you are cooking. You don\u2019t need a strong, rapid boil for the eggs; what you want is a gentle simmer. The technique that works well for me is to crack each egg into a small teacup, carefully lower into the water, let it congeal a bit in the cup, and then leave it to poach. The eggs should be ready in about 3-5 minutes, depending on the temperature of the water. \u000a

Topped with a generous helping of smoked salmon and a delicate sliver of lemon and finished with a spray of fresh dill, the sandwich is sturdy enough to fill your belly but the takeaway is its light, refreshing interplay of sweet, tart, salty and crunchy flavors.

VI am excited to introduce a new column here at The Year in Food! The Tippler is dedicated to cocktail culture, homemade bitters and liqueurs and the like, and the people who make it amazing. My pal James from  Slow Club  agreed to share one of his favorite cocktails for this, the inaugural installment. Thanks, James!  The drink\u2019s name is in reference to an 1823 uprising in what is now Guyana. Upwards of 10,000 slaves from the region\u2019s sugar plantations rebelled against the British in the town of Demerara. The rum he uses in the cocktail comes from the same town.  One of the things I enjoy most about James\u2019 drinks is that they are always well-balanced \u2013 never cloyingly sweet or too heavy on the acids, and this is no exception. The Demerara 1823 is a cozy, late-winter kind of affair with a pleasing interplay of spicy notes and citrus. Bottoms up!

VThere is something of a mythology around the art and craft of baking. Consider this gorgeous video about  Chad Robertson and his wildly successful Tartine , for instance. Or this piece on  the relationship between bread and craft  written by my former advisor at CCA, maker and bon vivant Donald Fortescue. Or consider  Tucson\u2019s legendary pizzaiolo Chris Bianco . People are dedicated.  For this pizza, I followed Nate Appleman\u2019s long rise method, leaving the dough to rest overnight in the fridge, then bringing it out the following morning to let it grow and stretch over the course of another four hours. I divided the dough, shaped it into four balls, cranked the oven to its maximum, and let the dough rest and rise again. It\u2019s so easy to opt for the shortest or the fastest method, but the beauty of this dough is that it won\u2019t let you. It demands patience.  As for the toppings on the pie, they live in that indeterminate zone between late winter and early spring \u2013 lighter than a winter dish but employing the best of the season. Don\u2019t be put off by the Meyer lemon \u2013 it\u2019s mellowed by the heat of the oven and provides a bright citrus note that works well with the Fontina and ricotta cheeses. The broccoli rabe is sauteed first in some olive oil with chile flakes, so that once every few bites you get a tingle of heat. It\u2019s finished with a sprinkle of fresh thyme. (And if you want to throw some pancetta on there, I doubt anybody will mind.) This Pizza with Broccoli Rabe, Fontina and Meyer Lemon recipe is part of  The February Seasonal Food Guide

p4622
aVIn a large mixing bowl, sprinkle yeast over the warm water and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the olive oil and salt. Slowly add the flour to the yeast mixture, in 1/2-1 cup increments, stirring constantly to combine. (You can also use a stand mixer if you have one.) \u000a

aVThe next day, remove the dough from the fridge. Punch it down, re-shape into a ball and let stand, covered, for at least 4 hours. \u000a
p4626
aVWhen dough is ready, divide into four. Shape into rounds. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for at least 1/2 hour more. \u000a
p4627
aVOne hour before you are ready to bake the pizza, turn your oven to its highest temperature, which is generally between 500-550 degrees. Place oven rack at lowest position, and slide pizza stone onto rack. \u000a

p4631
aVHeat a large pan over medium heat. Add the olive oil and chili flakes and stir. When the oil is hot, add the broccoli rabe and stir again. Keep covered and saute for about 4-6 minutes, until the greens are wilted and tender. Set aside. \u000a
p4632
aVGrate the Fontina cheese. Mince the thyme, thinly slice the lemons. Have all of your toppings ready and at hand. \u000a
p4633
aVTake one ball of dough and place it on a well-floured surface. Press into the center of the round with your palm to flatten. Using a rolling pin, roll from the center of the dough outward in all directions, working to maintain a circular shape. When the dough is between 10 and 12 inches, transfer to a pizza peel or a rimless baking sheet.\u000a
p4634
aVApply your toppings like so: begin with 1/3 cup ricotta, smoothing it over the dough with a spatula. Next, sprinkle 1 teaspoon thyme over the ricotta. Follow with 1/4 of the lemon, 1/2 cup of grated Fontina, and finish with 1/4 of the broccoli rabe. \u000a

aVOpen the oven and gently slide the pizza off the peel and onto the baking stone with a jerk of the arm. \u000a

VTomatillos are such peculiar fruits. Between their brown husks, unpleasantly sticky surface and curious smell, they\u2019re not exactly welcoming. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d consider them a prime candidate for consumption were I a neanderthal. But some curious soul did, and we reap the benefits. And thank goodness. Salsa verde is devilishly good stuff, what with that anchor of tangy goodness from the tomatillos, and the winning combination of avocado, onion and cilantro. Salsa\u2019s simplicity sometimes blows me away \u2013 it\u2019s amazing how much flavor can be culled from the simplest of ingredients. I\u2019ve been enjoying this on my morning eggs, tucked into warm corn tortillas and finished with a little feta. It\u2019s equally good by the spoonful all by itself (and, of course, with tortilla chips and any kind of taco imaginable).   This Salsa Verde with Avocado recipe is part of the  August Seasonal Food Guide.

VWhen I was three or four years old, I got the idea to make my mom some eggs one morning. I wanted to surprise her; perhaps it was her birthday. I had this amazing toy stove and oven, sized to my child height, whose stovetop burners, when the dial was turned, would shift from black to red, giving an illusion of heat. Although it never actually warmed, I was convinced that I could cook things on it. Having no idea what went into scrambled eggs, and possessing a well-developed sweet tooth, I thought that it would be smart to add sugar to the eggs. Imagine a child\u2019s toy skillet filled with raw, whisked eggs to which a generous quantity of sugar has been added. I remained convinced that after a while the eggs would start to do what they did when my mom cooked them. My mom caught me in the act, and she was not pleased that I had wasted the eggs and the sugar, so she cooked them for me on the real stove. And she made me eat them, which was an awful punishment for a well-meaning kid. I was thinking about this recently because it\u2019s my first food memory, and it\u2019s not a pleasant one. But what\u2019s amazing to me is that it didn\u2019t deter me from cooking.  You hear stories so frequently of traumatic food memories turning people off to a dish for years, even decades, perhaps an entire life. We could talk about watermelon, chocolate milk or ketchup and I would happily chime in. But I\u2019m so happy that having to eat a plate of repulsive, sugary eggs as a toddler didn\u2019t keep me from cooking.  Consider these pancakes. They\u2019re fluffy little pillows of Sunday morning heaven. There\u2019s something very straightforward in the pleasure of a pancake. Its levity, its texture, its hint of sweetness, its buttery edge. The citrus preserves are sort of like a cheater\u2019s jam \u2013 you just simmer down a variety of citrus fruits until they\u2019ve thickened up, and serve it with your lovely pancakes. Easy perfection. This Buckwheat Pancake recipe is part of    The February Seasonal Food Guide

VEvery year for the last five years, I\u2019ve made a trip up to the remote northwestern reaches of Montana to get lost in the woods for a week or two. Most years, it\u2019s a last-minute decision; as summer ambles along, my desire to get out of town and away from the reaches of cell phones and internet grows in pitch until I give in and find myself obsessively poring over maps and catching up on the latest grizzly reports in the park. I just can\u2019t seem to get enough of the place. When I\u2019m up there, I don\u2019t give much thought to food except in its most basic form: protein-rich stuff that\u2019ll keep me going on a 10 or 12 mile hike. My days are spent on the trail, in ridiculously pristine forests that are rich with wildlife and no shortage of unbelievably stunning mountain vistas. Food is just sustenance: dense bread slathered with almond butter and eaten hastily in the morning, a cheese sandwich at the mountaintop mid-day. Not to say that it doesn\u2019t taste incredibly good, though: when hiking so much, you generate a monstrous appetite, and a simple cheese sandwich can be a transportive thing. Chips and salsa (and a cold beer) never taste better than after six hours of hiking. Were I continuing my at-home eating habits out there, however, I would totally be making and eating this hummus everyday. It passes all the tests: it\u2019s protein-rich, healthy, easy and addictively delicious. And cranberry beans really bring it to life. The freshness of the beans shines, and they possess a lovely nutty quality that is a welcome twist on classic hummus. It\u2019s denser than a lot of hummus, too, but you can thin it with a little of the cooking water from the beans, or with more olive oil. The quiet anise notes of the chervil round everything out nicely.  This Cranberry Bean Hummus recipe is part of the  August Seasonal Food Guide

VThe time feels a little wonky today, owing to that hour leap forward. I marvel at the difference an hour makes every year, throwing one day out of whack as we adjust to the disconnect between the light in the sky and the time on the clock.  I listened to the latest episode of  Radiolab  while making this risotto. It\u2019s about how we get in the way of ourselves, how short term goals sometimes stand as obstacles to long term aspirations. And how people navigate that and overcome it \u2013 our small and large triumphs. Which reminded me of  Nicholas Kristof\u2019s thoughtful, inspired editorial  that talked about the resilience of the Japanese, how stoic and resolved they are in the face of this rather incomprehensible tragedy. And let\u2019s not forget  the man who survived on the roof of his house, nine miles out to sea,  amidst all the turbulence of the tsunami. That made me weepy. His story was, I think, a small triumph in the midst so many great tragedies. We all need a little bit of that. Between the weather, the time change and the surreality of what\u2019s unfolding in Japan, there is something especially sweet and comforting in the act of being read to. So let me direct you to that stellar hour of  Radiolab.  Let them be your narrators today, whether you\u2019re making a rainy day risotto, cleaning the house, or burrowing under the covers.

VThis is one of those devilishly simple recipes that is something of a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. (Unless your crowd aren\u2019t fans of mussels, in which case, perhaps you should reconsider your allegiances.) The single most labor-intensive element of this recipe is the scrubbing of the mussels. It\u2019s briny, salty, tangy, simple goodness. The beer adds a little tartness. The bread will be happily sopped and a loaf might disappear in minutes. The fennel is perfect here \u2013 it just barely flavors the broth but is a refreshing counterpoint in between greedy bites of mussel and bread. Make it for your friends the next time you have them over.  This Mussels and Fennel in Ale recipe is part of the  March Seasonal Food Guide Note: The test kitchen (aka my lovely sister) reported back with a glitch: the cream curdled when added to the broth. Following some awesome feedback on  Food52\u2032s Foodpickler , we\u2019ve nailed it: 1) Make sure you\u2019ve turned off the heat before adding the cream; 2) Try to find a low-acid Belgian ale. 3) Add the cream slowly.

VIt\u2019s important to use mussels the same day that you buy them. Just before you begin, carefully place the mussels in a large bowl of cold water for about ten minutes. Scrub the mussels to remove any debris attached to their shells. Debeard them by either yanking the beard or slicing with a knife. If any mussels are open, tap them against the counter to urge them closed. If they remain open after a minute or two, they aren\u2019t alive and should be discarded. Likewise discard any mussels whose shells are cracked or broken. When you place the mussels in the broth, you want to make sure that they all begin closed. \u000a
p4992
aVHeat a large pot over a medium flame. Add the tablespoon of butter. Add the fennel, shallots and garlic and stir. Saute them for about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent anything from browning. When the fennel has started to soften, add the ale, mustard and parsley, along with salt and pepper to your liking. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. \u000a
p4993
aVAt this time, add the mussels. Again, make sure that they are all closed at this point. Cover and let them steam for about 5 minutes. When the mussels have opened wide, they are cooked. Remove them with a slotted spoon as they do so. Discard any mussels that don\u2019t open. \u000a
p4994
aVWhen all the mussels are opened, turn off the heat. Stir in the two tablespoons cream. Add the broth to the mussels and serve in a large bowl, or divided amongst two or three smaller bowls. And have plenty of bread on hand!\u000a

VThis might be my new favorite dessert. I am rather enamored with the color of this sorbet, which is almost like bubblegum in its pure, pink vibrancy. And even if it\u2019s raining outside, and has been all week, and I have a mental block where frozen desserts and cold weather are concerned, I still haven\u2019t been able to resist this. It\u2019s refreshing and light, a little tart and a little sweet, the absolute definition of a palate cleanser. If you were feeling bold and had a mind to serve it in between courses, your guests would approve, enthusiastically.   Most recipes called for double the sugar used here; I opted for much less because I didn\u2019t want the flavor of the rhubarb to be obscured by too much sugar. It has such a lovely tart and fresh flavor and it\u2019d be a shame to hide that. Here, it\u2019s the star of the show, fortified by a little lemon juice and a little ginger. A lot of recipes for sorbet also call for corn syrup, because it helps the texture. Instead, I\u2019ve used a tiny amount of gin, which won\u2019t affect the flavor but provides the same benefit. Now go forth and make yourself some rhubarb sorbet. (And consider pairing it with Sparkling Ink\u2019s  Ginger Cookies. This Rhubarb Sorbet recipe is part of the  March Seasonal Food Guide

VIt\u2019s funny how sometimes the memory of a dish will follow you around for months, even years. It was sometime last spring that I had a dish like that, at  Range  here in San Francisco. The memorable dish was remarkably simple, though I didn\u2019t know that at the time: Cod a la Nage.  A la nage  has something to with swimming in French, and refers to the cooking technique, wherein you poach the fish in a lovely broth of wine, aromatics and butter. I wasn\u2019t too keen, however, on the ridiculous quantity of butter traditionally called for, and so I opted to boost the flavor of the broth with coconut milk. Coupled with the tangy, lemony flavors of sorrel, the delicate qualities of beech mushrooms and the anisette notes of tarragon, it\u2019s a perfect, light dish for spring.  This Poached Cod in Coconut Milk Recipe is part of the  April Seasonal Food Guide  (but can be eaten long after April\u2019s passed!)

VAlthough I am not expecting the end times to ramp into high gear come 6 o\u2019clock this evening, I do like to consider what the world would be like if we no longer had electricity, gas, running water, the internet. (Oh, life without internet.) Sometimes I\u2019ll follow this trajectory a ways, fancying myself an amateur survivalist (watch me construct a log cabin and forage all my food!) and imagining some kind of simpler (harder) life.  As a kid, I was fascinated by my mom\u2019s  Foxfire  books, which bill themselves as a guide to  plain living  but are something of an unintentional survivalist manual. They were produced by a bunch of high school students in rural Georgia in the late 1960s, underperforming kids who, at the encouragement of their young and enthusiastic teacher, went up into the Appalachian woods of their grandparents and started asking them how things were done back in the old days. The cover is a stark, plain cream with brown text that states: \u201chog dressing, log cabin building, mountain crafts and foods \u2026 faith healing, moonshining and other affairs of plain living.\u201d Apocalypse or no, my tattered copy of Foxfire is on the short list of items to grab when that proverbial house is burning down.  All of this, of course, has nothing to do with this lovely, straightforward recipe for baby artichokes, unless you were of a mind to go forage some of your own. But let\u2019s just switch gears and assume that we will have supermarkets, farmer\u2019s markets, electricity and all the other wonders of contemporary life when tomorrow rolls around. Baby artichokes are worth celebration. Roasted this way, they\u2019re just a little bit less finicky than their grown-up brethren, because a far greater portion of the artichoke is edible in its young, tender state. Paired with tender, sweet onion scapes, this is the epitome of fine spring living. Now go on and enjoy your produce before the world ends.  This Roasted Artichokes with Onion Scapes recipe is part of  The May Seasonal Food Guide.

It reminds me of being in school \u2013 frantically jotting down bits of inspiration and wisdom, feeling motivated, engaged, challenged. And it\u2019s made me fall in love with photography all over again, and been a powerful reminder as to why I fell in love with it in the first place: light and color, the act of slowing down to observe, the act of pausing and recording a moment.  Penny has an amazingly holistic approach; it\u2019s so much greater in scope than getting the perfectly composed shot of food. It\u2019s the small moments, the little details, the juicy and unscripted raw elements that compose the majority of our lives \u2013 she knows how to get right in the middle of that. And she does a damn good job of documenting it.  This has everything and nothing to do with fiddlehead ferns. My photographic focus lately has been so tightly centered on the food on the plate, on food without its cultural context. That is to say, I didn\u2019t get any shots of  Far West Fungi , where I bought the fiddleheads, or the man whom I bought them from, or the couple I chatted with about how we might prepare them. They were the ones who inspired the idea for this pizza. Thanks to all those people who inform my work, and the food that I make, and who keep me inspired.  And pretty please: Don\u2019t go picking fiddleheads in your backyard/on your weekend hike unless you\u2019ve got a trusted source who says they\u2019re safe to eat. Not all types of young ferns are edible This Flatbread with Fiddlehead Ferns, Onion Scapes and Pecorino Recipe is part of the  May Seasonal Food Guide.

VI have long wanted to do a version of this sandwich here at The Year in Food. When I was in college, I was kind of obsessed with a version of this served at our school\u2019s cafe. The ingredients are surprising and unexpected in a tuna sandwich: coconut, cilantro, walnuts and capers. It might sound weird, and I never would have considered this had I not first tried it at the cafe, but it\u2019s pretty darn addictively delicious. It adds some of the elements of a banh mi sandwich and mashes them up with tuna. And it lacks mayonnaise, a plus for those of us who aren\u2019t fans of mayonnaise in our tuna fish sandwiches.  So when the lovely ladies at  Big Girls Small Kitchen  proposed their  Brown Bag Challenge , this was a natural choice. The recipe below is for a single sandwich, but it\u2019s easily scaled up. And it\u2019s a cinch to make. Enjoy!

VPerhaps you absentmindedly opened a bottle of champagne in the wee hours one adventurous weekend night, opening it and then promptly falling asleep before consuming its effervescent contents. It doesn\u2019t matter that it was only $8.99, and can\u2019t rightfully be called champagne because it was just a California sparkling wine \u2013 it\u2019s still a pity to see it go to waste. So what you do is put that bottle in the fridge and reserve it for your next batch of poached pears.  The beauty of a poached pear is in its lightness. Aside from a conservative 1/4 cup of sugar, and whatever natural sugars are in the sparkling wine and the fruit itself, this almost doesn\u2019t qualify as dessert. There\u2019s something classy and understated about the presentation: a graceful, naked pear in an amber-hued pool of syrup that was made, almost effortlessly, by reducing the poaching liquid. Does dessert get much simpler?

VWhen I was younger and a dedicated vegetarian, my mother picked up a paperback copy of the seminal vegetarian guide  Laurel\u2019s Kitchen . There was something kind of mystical and wholesome about that book and the lifestyle it espoused, the way the women sat about in their prairie dresses around a wood table, long hair pinned back, kneading bread, having  significant  moments, discussing the finer points of, say, mung beans. It seemed quiet and peaceful and idyllic to me back then \u2013 glorified, simple. No longer vegetarian, I kind of forgot about the book, having relegated it to the dusty annals of my hippie years.  So it was a pleasant surprise, then, when I got in touch with an old roommate about her borscht recipe, the first I\u2019d tried and also my favorite, and she told me that it was adapted from  Laurel\u2019s Kitchen . We lived in Santa Cruz then. Of course.  Every winter I get a strong hankering for the stuff, for its knockout color and intense contrast of sweet and tart and salty. I am convinced that its shocking magenta is capable of warding off winter doldrums. The strong flavors of the beet are tempered by the stock, the dill and the vinegar, making it more palatable for those who may not enjoy beets alone. It\u2019s easy and quick enough to make on a weeknight, and would serve a family well or be a great workaday lunch throughout the week.

VWhen I purchased a mandoline for the kitchen a couple years ago, I thought that I had arrived as a home cook. I envisioned perfectly composed dishes with paper-thin slices of fennel, or potatoes, or beets, or whatever it was that I wanted to pass along the blade of the instrument. But in two years, I believe that I\u2019ve used it about four times. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s kind of a hassle: it\u2019s cumbersome, and the parts aren\u2019t easy to clean, and it winds up being more of a bother than it\u2019s worth. What I\u2019ve discovered is that I\u2019m okay with loose edges, irregular cuts and a little imperfection. I think that gets at the heart of home cooking.  But then there are those single-purpose tools that are neither cumbersome nor a burden. For instance, the julienne peeler. I just got my hands on this little dude, and I\u2019m kind of smitten. How many times have we encountered recipes that call for julienned this or julienned that and have painstakingly done the work with a knife? And despite my protestations about too much perfection, it does a good job of making things look pretty. I write about mandolines and julienne peelers because they\u2019re rather helpful where salads like these are concerned. The goal is to marinate the summer squash, and the thinner your slice, the more effective the job. I first fell in love with a version of this salad at the lovely little restaurant called  Evoe  in Portland. The men behind the counter, both more chef than server, were smart and sassy and infinitely knowledgeable about simple, seasonal food. In fact, the food was so good that I walked around Portland in 95 degree heat in order to work up an appetite again so that I could stuff my face with a second round of their amazing dishes. And ever since, this simple salad has become a staple of my summer repertoire. There are so many ways to prepare it: take your choice of herbs, cheeses, acids (vinegar would do just as well as lemon juice), add some other summer produce if you wish, or present it in its simplest form. It\u2019s classic and easy and perfect for a warm evening when there are better things to do than cook.  This Summer Squash Salad with Little Gems recipe is part of the  July Seasonal Food Guide

VFirst, prepare the squash. As mentioned, you can use a mandoline or a julienne peeler to achieve slender strands of the raw squash. If you don\u2019t have either of these, a vegetable peeler will produce long, slender ribbons that are equally attractive. Just run the peeler slowly down the length of the squash.\u000a
p5413
aVNext, gently toss the squash with the lemon juice and olive oil and enough salt and pepper to taste. Leave to marinate at room temperature for about an hour, tossing occasionally.\u000a
p5414
aVAfter an hour has passed, drain the squash so that there is no excess liquid. \u000a
p5415
aVDivide the squash equally amongst the little gem lettuce leaves. Top with crumbled feta. If serving as finger food, nestle the quartered tomatoes into the squash. If serving on plates, arrange the tomatoes around the salad. Best served immediately. \u000a

VThere are so many ways to prepare it: take your choice of herbs, cheeses, acids (vinegar would do just as well as lemon juice), add some other summer produce if you wish, or present it in its simplest form.

aVI envisioned perfectly composed dishes with paper-thin slices of fennel, or potatoes, or beets, or whatever it was that I wanted to pass along the blade of the instrument.
p5419
aVThe men behind the counter, both more chef than server, were smart and sassy and infinitely knowledgeable about simple, seasonal food.
p5420
aVIn fact, the food was so good that I walked around Portland in 95 degree heat in order to work up an appetite again so that I could stuff my face with a second round of their amazing dishes.

VAt the tail end of last month, during that part of the year when the light seems kind of haunted in all its nuanced depth and shadow,  101 Cookbooks  posted a simple recipe for a  rustic casserole  that inspired me to make my own version that very night. Go take a look at the image and tell me you wouldn\u2019t do the same. I improvised, a lot, and what emerged wasn\u2019t really an adaptation of hers so much as an inspired casserole of my own that took advantage of what I had on hand.  The success of this gratin owes a lot to the simple, winning combination of potatoes and cheese, here a happy marriage of piquant Parmesan and creamy goat cheese. I also omitted milk. Who needs milk when you\u2019ve got cheese? The kale\u2019s presence is subtle but welcome \u2013 a little bit of tooth and texture and a burst of sharp green in between all the savory and starchy goodness of this incredibly satisfying winter dish. Plus, only seven ingredients! You can\u2019t beat that.

VPreheat oven to 400 degrees. (Place your cast-iron skillet on the stove so it absorbs some of the heat from the oven.)\u000a
p5466
aVBring a pot of water to boil. Boil the potatoes until they are still firm but cooked through, about 20 minutes. Drain, rinse under cool water, and drain again. Slice the potatoes into thin rounds, about 1/8 of an inch thick. Salt the potatoes lightly and set aside. \u000a
p5467
aVMeanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over a medium flame. Add the leeks and saute until just soft, stirring occasionally, about three minutes. Add half the kale to the pan and stir; once it has reduced, add the remaining kale and saute until the greens are just wilted. Stir in the minced thyme and remove from heat. \u000a
p5468
aVLightly grease your warmed skillet, and arrange a layer of potatoes in the bottom. Over that, arrange about 1/2 of the kale and leek mix. Press it down lightly so that the surface is somewhat flat. Crumble 1/2 of the goat cheese over the greens, and sprinkle 1/3 of the Parmesan. Repeat with another layer of potatoes, the remaining greens and goat cheese, and another third of the Parmesan. Top the gratin with a final layer of potatoes, the remainder of the Parmesan cheese, and a healthy sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper and sea salt. \u000a

VDo you remember the scene in  Mad Men  where Betty Draper\u2019s father  sprinkled salt over his ice cream ? And how Betty\u2019s daughter Sally thought it was weird but he explained that he had a salt tooth? I am the same. I have, embarrassingly, been known to eat anchovies straight out of the jar. When I am in my 60s and have terrible blood pressure issues, I will probably regret this. For now, I try to justify the habit with lots of walking.  Pickles are the perfect indulgence for a person with a salt tooth. And they are a classic ritual of mid- and late-summer. They are both a celebration of everything abundant about the season and an homage to its transience. And pickles are so simple and so easy to make that you may question the merits of a tame supermarket pickle after making your own.  Sea Beans go by many names: their Latin name is Salicornia, but they\u2019re also known as sea asparagus, glasswort, samphire and pickleweed. Hank Shaw has an awesome summary of this lovely, salt-loving plant over at  Honest Food. And if you\u2019re averse to okra, these pickles may just be what tips the scales in their favor for you. I think okra was born to be pickled.   These Sea Bean Pickles and Spicy Okra Pickles are part of the  July Seasonal Food Guide. Note: because sea beans are naturally salty, no further salt is needed for the pickling process. Bring vinegar, water, sugar and spices to a boil. Once boiling, turn off heat.  Meanwhile, remove any brown parts from the sea beans.  Thoroughly sanitize and rinse the jar you\u2019ll use and keep it hot for when you pour the brine in. Pack the sea beans in the jar. Tuck the garlic cloves in. Pour the hot brine over the beans. Let the jar sit, uncovered, until it has cooled, about an hour. Cover and refrigerate. (Because these are quick pickles, they\u2019ll need to be kept refrigerated.)

VI have never really been a fan of lemon coupled with poppy seeds, whether in muffin or bread or cake form. But I had these grapefruits on hand, and I wanted to incorporate them into a baked good, something cozy and snacky and rather wholesome. I contemplated a grapefruit curd (more dessertish than desired), a grapefruit-scented scone. I am not entirely sure why, when I saw Lottie + Doof\u2019s handsome  Poppy Seed Cake  yesterday, poppy seeds and grapefruit seemed like a good match. I think it had something to do with how attractive that little square slice was, how it hearkened to some vague Eastern European childhood that wasn\u2019t mine to claim. So I reconsidered the humble poppy seed loaf. And it turned out wonderfully.  Grapefruit in this context is quieter and sweeter than its small yellow cousin. Where lemons are bright, loud and forward, the grapefruit is gentle, subtle, quiet. It  perfumes  the bread, and I mean that in the best possible way. And the poppy seeds add a wonderful texture where in other places you might have thrown in a handful of nuts. The olive oil and yogurt keep the bread moist and are a really fantastic substitute for eggs and butter. Plus, it adds this vaguely Mediterranean quality to the bread. I like to think so, anyway.

VLately I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of Willie Nelson. He\u2019s pretty much perfect for summertime, what with that winsome, triumphant, bittersweet music that sometimes verges on minimal. When you land on something whose simplicity transports you, it\u2019s kind of a revelation. I\u2019m dreaming of road trips with lots of Willie Nelson, lost in thoughts and fantasizing about popsicles to punctuate the long, hot drives.  Originally I had some fancy ice pops in mind, kind of a frozen version of a perfect dark chocolate bar. One that incorporated expensive sea salts, toasted almonds and the like. But something about their fussiness wasn\u2019t really sitting well. So I returned to this \u2013 it\u2019s basically a frozen version of your favorite summer berry jam, or your favorite berry pie, or your favorite berry crumble. Just imagine those flavors concentrated and frozen and without a crust. And with some fresh mint to top things off. Right now, their simplicity is really hitting the spot.  These Summer Berry + Mint Ice Pops are part of the  July Seasonal Food Guide PS: If you\u2019re in a popsicle mood, you might want to check out these  Horchata Pops  that I made for Etsy\u2019s blog!

VAs much as I adore fava beans, the labor involved in shelling them sometimes dissuades me from cooking with them. Last year, when I first gave this pan-roasted method a whirl, I was blown away. You get all the joy of the fava bean, but the preparation is so heartbreakingly simple that it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s the same, fussy bean. The pods take on a smoky quality somewhat similar to shisito peppers.  It\u2019s important to select young, tender pods when you prepare them whole, because the larger pods tend to be tougher and chewier and don\u2019t take so well to the pan.

Salads that are unbelievably easy to prepare, which is important right now, because there are more important things to be doing.

VA couple weekends ago I had the pleasure of spending a rainy afternoon at a cozy workshop called Producer Saturdays. Conceived by  Maggie Spicer , the idea behind the series is to bring together people passionate about food (and drink) culture who have something of value, a specialty or niche, that they\u2019d like to share with a group of enthusiastic folks. Is there a better way to spend a rainy Saturday? Besides being curled up in bed with kitties, books and a fireplace, probably not.  And what an action-packed afternoon it was. Led by the charming Maxine Sharkey Giammo, we learned about nitrous extraction, limoncello-making and homemade tonics. (More on that soon.) We focused on limoncello because our lovely peak citrus season is nearing a close, and this is the perfect way to preserve their flavors. While limoncello is traditionally made with Eureka lemons, the sky\u2019s the limit here. We made a round of bergamot-infused liquor, the same citrus used to flavor Earl Grey tea, and whose heady, bitter perfume is a pretty dynamite starting point for this digestif. You could use any citrus you want, really: oranges, limes, tangerines, pomelos, grapefruit.  Limoncello is one of those processes that doesn\u2019t require a lot of work, but does ask for a fair amount of patience. Ideally, you\u2019ll want to let it cure over the course of at least a month. (I cheated with my bergamot version, though, and it still taste pretty magnificent!)  The Tippler is a monthly column dedicated to cocktail culture.

p5774
aVTo make the simple syrup, simmer the water and the sugar over a low heat just long enough to dissolve the sugar. Do not bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool to room temperature. When cool, add the simple syrup to the limoncello, tasting as you go. Allow it to rest for another 10-14 days. \u000a

VAmong my friends and family, a lot of seafood is consumed this time of year. It somehow feels light and celebratory while retaining the richness and decadence that is essential to December. And in California, it\u2019s so much a part of the season \u2013 the Dungeness crab catch begins, generally, right around Thanksgiving. I can\u2019t get enough of it. It\u2019s sweet and tender and tastes terrific with anything sparkling. It\u2019s great on its own, steamed and then dredged piece by piece in warm butter, or tucked into a  warming seafood stew . I\u2019ve done all of the above lately. It makes me feel lucky. Steaming crab in champagne sounds more decadent than it is \u2013 the champagne serves the purpose that any dry white would, adding a lovely depth to what is basically a very straightforward butter sauce. And it\u2019s that time of year anyway. We should all have bottles of sparkling things on hand.  Last week I hosted a winter dinner party for friends. It was simple.  Cioppino , adapted from my mom\u2019s recipe. Those fancy Gilt Taste potatoes, roasted and tossed with an arugula pesto, inspired by  Not Without Salt\u2019s recent recipe . A kale salad. Pears poached in apple brandy,  not unlike these. And last, a vivacious round of  Cards Against Humanity , the most hilarious and most terrible game ever. It\u2019s sold out for now, but get on their email list if you like making terrible, inappropriate jokes with trusted friends who aren\u2019t easily offended.  What a tremendous year. Happy New Year, all.

VThis recipe is for cooked crab. Before you buy it, smell the crab to make sure there is no ammoniac odor \u2013 a sign the crab is past its prime. Have your fishmonger crack and clean it for you. Use it, ideally, the day you purchase it. Store it upside down on ice in the fridge. \u000a
p5899
aVIf it hasn\u2019t been cracked and cleaned, remove the top hard shell and thoroughly rinse out and remove the gills and fat. Separate each leg where it attaches to the body. Slice the center of the body in half. Set aside. My friend Anna has a great little tutorial at her site, \u000a
p5900
aVhere.\u000a
p5901
aVWarm a large pan or medium, wide pot with lid over a medium flame. If you are cooking more than one crab, use a large Dutch oven or similar pot. Add two tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the garlic, stirring frequently to prevent browning. When the garlic is fragrant, add the champagne. Saute for a couple minutes, then add two tablespoons of the parsley. \u000a
p5902
aVNext, add the crab, body and legs, and cover. Steam for about 7-9 minutes. You want to get the internal temperature of the crab to 165 degrees. \u000a
p5903
aVWhen the crab has been thoroughly reheated, remove from pot. Melt the last tablespoon of butter. Pour butter into small serving dish. Add remaining parsley. Serve.\u000a

VSteaming crab in champagne sounds more decadent than it is \u2013 the champagne serves the purpose that any dry white would, adding a lovely depth to what is basically a very straightforward butter sauce.

VLast week I went on a little getaway to Death Valley. We were trying to catch that rare window where the weather is just right: somewhere in the neighborhood of 80-something degrees. The heat was already there, though, regularly climbing to 99 degrees in the afternoons, in the shade. Locals will scoff at this and remind you that on their terms, this is merely warm. It\u2019s a relative thing, of course. I went away for lots of reasons \u2013 for that dry desert heat, challenging and brutal as it can be around high noon, for spring flowers and the creepy trill of coyotes at night. For remote bars in rural Nevada where the town heartthrob offers impromptu lessons in line-dancing and toothless men try to dance with you. For spring-fed swimming pools frequented by bats in the dusky evenings. For the vastness of the landscape, and what a place as wide open and desolate as that will do for mental clarity. For long walks in frightfully surreal Martian landscapes that really beg the question,  How did I get here? These sardines, on the other hand, do not beg any questions except to be eaten. They are simple, marvelous, fresh and absurdly easy to prepare. They put tinned sardines to shame. In fact, they\u2019re hardly related. (Distant second cousins once removed, at best.) They are roasted at a very high heat in a glaze of olive oil, salt and pepper, and then topped with a simple gremolata. They come out crispy and salty and delicious, balanced by the punch of the garlic and the bright, fresh notes of the parsley and lemon. It\u2019s all you need for a warm spring evening. This Roasted Sardines with Green Garlic Gremolata recipe is part of the  April Seasonal Food Guide.

VIn winters past, brussels sprouts were my go-to, the cruciferous vegetable that I could not get enough of and would eat multiple times a week until the season had been exhausted. This year it\u2019s cauliflower. And while I could eat it almost every night simply sauteed with a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper in a little olive oil, when you do something like this, you take the pale vegetable to another level. It\u2019s kind of perfect \u2013 you have this large, handsome cross section of cauliflower (thank you,  Bon Appetit , for the inspiration), providing a maximum surface for deep caramelization and striking presentation, the smoky heft of the fire-roasted pepper, a welcome chili heat and the warmth of dry-roasted spices. I\u2019d never made harissa before. Its homemade iteration puts the store bought paste to shame. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t make twice as much \u2013 it\u2019s so good that I could spoon it out of a jar by itself, all day, and slather it on every meal. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and make a double batch. Oh, and PS: Check out this simple  Hearty Chicken Chili  that I made for Etsy\u2019s blog. It\u2019s absolutely perfect for the cold and wintry weather that we\u2019re finally having.

VFirst, make the harissa. If you have a gas stove, skewer the whole bell pepper and roast it directly on the gas flame, turning every minute or two until the entire surface is blackened. The metal skewer will get hot \u2013 be careful! Once charred, set aside to cool. \u000a

aVNext, roast the cumin, coriander and caraway seeds in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, two to three minutes. Remove from heat and grind using a mortar and pestle or spice mill. Set aside. \u000a
p6001
aVAdd the tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet, along with the red onion, chiles and garlic, and stir until translucent and browned, about 7-8 minutes. Set aside to cool. \u000a
p6002
aVPeel the charred skin from the bell pepper under cool running water. Core and remove seeds and dice. \u000a
p6003
aVIn a food processor or blender, combine the red pepper, ground spices, onion, garlic and chile with the remaining harissa ingredients and process until smooth. Set aside until needed. \u000a
p6004
aVPreheat oven to 400 degrees. \u000a
p6005
aVStanding the cauliflower upright, slice in half vertically at the center, and then make 4 steaks, about 3/4 inch thick. You\u2019ll want to make sure that the core is intact in order to hold the steaks together. \u000a

aVWorking in two batches, fry the steaks over medium heat on both sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side. \u000a

VAs much as I love the beginning of every season, there is none more exciting for me than the start of summer. It\u2019s so full of leisurely promise: spending as much time as possible out of doors, whether it\u2019s picnicking, hiking or lazy tubing in a lake; sunny days that give way to balmy evenings, and that amazing summer light that slowly drains from the sky; camping and campfires; cold, sparkling beverages of all stripes; and of course, summer produce.  While this salad wrap may not exactly highlight the peak of summer produce \u2013 its star seasonal ingredient is the demure, early summer apricot, after all \u2013 it has everything to do with the kind of outdoor culture that  does  reach its peak in summer. And if you haven\u2019t noticed, I have a thing for food that\u2019s secretly healthy. Here, the classic chicken salad gets a little messed with: where you would typically find absurd amounts mayonnaise or sour cream, there is only yogurt. And because of the apricots, paprika, cinnamon, chipotle and cumin, there\u2019s enough flavor going on that mayonnaise will be the last thing on your mind when chowing down. Make a bunch of wraps or sandwiches in the morning, pack \u2018em in your cooler, and get yourself to some grassy knoll or sandy beach.

VI have a hunch that there are some magical blues-obliterating qualities to citrus. Have you noticed how much they lift a person\u2019s spirits? I have. Consider this some terribly unprofessional research data: it seems that all of the best-loved images of mine on  Instagram  (my new favorite thing) are of citrus. Well, citrus and buffaloes, and chocolate. You people know what\u2019s important in life. I think it means that we like to look at things that make us happy.  But really. We\u2019re lucky to have this family of fruit in the middle of the dreariest part of winter, all those bright pinks and oranges and golds and yellows (and greens), all that intensely sweet-tart flavor. I can\u2019t get enough of them. I don\u2019t remember growing up with broiled grapefruit. But I do remember those peculiar, serrated spoons that one used when eating grapefruit. Eating these, I wouldn\u2019t have minded a toothy spoon in hand. But a fork and knife will do.  They\u2019re part fancy brunch side, part healthy dessert, and entirely delicious. The honey-sweetened yogurt is the perfect foil for a grapefruit\u2019s tarter qualities, calming and balancing its puckery flavor. Choose a variety of citrus for color and flavor and texture. Pairing a huge, handsomely-hued  pomelo  with two types of grapefruit worked perfectly. I\u2019m almost certain that you\u2019ll make someone\u2019s day (even if just your own) in serving this.

VIt\u2019s that time of year again, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m referring not to holidays but to the annual wave of colds and flus making the rounds. The weather turns and folks are down for the count. I\u2019ve got a weapon against this \u2013 it\u2019s called soup. If you load a soup with fortifying vegetables such as onions, garlic, carrots and kale, you can think of it as a protector against the attack on your immune system. As unfancy as this soup may appear, it actually has a surprising depth and body to it. There are three little secret ingredients here: a handful of diced pancetta, a can of fire-roasted tomatoes and their tomatoey broth, and a sprinkle of grated cheese on top. Any hard cheese, nearly, will augment this soup. And those three flavors \u2013 the pork, tomato broth and cheese \u2013 make for something vaguely reminiscent of pasta in the broadest sense, keep it from being bland, and place it firmly in the category of healthy comfort food, which is my favorite. I\u2019ve been enjoying this soup all week. And it\u2019s done a pretty good job of keeping a teeny tiny cold from turning into a monstrous cold. Here\u2019s to staying healthy, friends.  Notes: This will yield a huge pot of soup. You can easily halve it. Vegetarians can forgo the pancetta and just sprinkle a little more cheese on top.

VWow. What a month this has been. When I embarked on this blog, there was a certain hope that it would be a path to something viable in the pursuit of the things I am most passionate about. But I didn\u2019t know what form that would take, or when it would happen, or what it would feel like. This month, I began to get a sense of that. My life went from a rather steady and reliable pace to one of breakneck speed. Some things had to be sacrificed, and for a few weeks, this was one of those things. This month there was a lot of meat. After cooking, shooting and styling  ten dishes with ground beef for Bon Appetit\u2019s site  and a ridiculous thirty dishes with bacon for another project, there was little appetite left for much of anything. Except, perhaps, a bowl of broccoli and an episode of Friday Night Lights. I continued  contributing to  Etsy\u2019s awesome blog ; I started a new monthly venture with  Oh Happy Day . (Yay!) I also hopped on-board with  Foodzie , helping them out with both photography and sourcing new artisan vendors. It\u2019s a great fit and I\u2019m thrilled to be involved with them. And I spent an epic Sunday shooting the  Good Food Awards judging panels  along with a bunch of other talented photographers. It was such a remarkable and rewarding day and totally reinforced that this is absolutely the community and the people that I want to spend my time with. That\u2019s the edited version of this month. It\u2019s been exciting and gratifying and stressful and exhausting.  There were the frazzled phone calls to my dad. (Thanks, Dad!) I found a little comfort in an  incredible podcast about quitting  from Freakonomics, a great reminder that we don\u2019t need to say yes to everything. And if I\u2019m gonna be really frank, I took solace in  Coach Taylor . All those slogans and phrases, for whatever they\u2019re worth, have a great purpose when you\u2019re essentially trying to coach yourself through some high tides. Clear eyes, full hearts. Seriously.  Now, the pace has slackened some and the appetite has returned. I can\u2019t tell you how awesome it is to revisit really simple foods that emphasize the produce of the season after working with so much meat. And if ever there is a time of year to enjoy apples at their best, this is it. So here\u2019s a little sandwich that is everything great about fall. Get the sharpest cheddar you can find, the crispest apple and a few sprigs of fresh sage, slather some bread with butter, plop it in a hot skillet, and you\u2019re set.

VOver the weekend, some friends and I hosted a Friendsgiving at my house. It\u2019s a winning Thanksgiving strategy: instead of the immense pressure on the host to prepare so many dishes, people bring their favorite sides and desserts, the host takes care of the bird, and everybody is happy. It was a tremendous success; every plate was cleaned and the turkey was devoured! (No turkey and cranberry sandwiches for us!)  One of my favorite dishes that evening was a simple twice-baked sweet potato. It starts as an update on the classic potato version. The sweetness of the tuber is tempered by sharp Parmesan, and in my efforts it gets a little tricked out with finely chopped thyme and kale. I ditched sour cream in favor of creamy Greek yogurt. Total win. This could easily be a light main course on a dreary winter night, too. Thanks for the inspiration, Britt!  Last week on Etsy I wrote about a lovely, simple way to use your holiday leftovers: in  Turkey, Apple and Cheddar Handpies . You\u2019ll also find a list of some of my favorite Thanksgiving dishes.  As for the bird, I used  Martha Stewart\u2019s brine  followed by  Gourmet\u2019s high heat roasting method  (nixing the salt as it was already brined) for a second year with great results.  And let\u2019s end this debate, once and for all:  there are no yams in North America.  They are all sweet potatoes. I trust Wikipedia on this one.

VMaking my own sea salt is something I\u2019ve long been interested in trying. But it\u2019s not exactly practical. First, you have to do a little research to figure out whether or not the seawater you\u2019ll be collecting is clean. Then, you trudge a large quantity of (very heavy) vessels from the beach. Next, you\u2019ll boil down the water over the course of a few hours. And from all that you\u2019ll get a handful of your very own sea salt. But there are a lot of reasons  t o do it. It\u2019s an opportunity to spend an afternoon at the beach, which alone merits the effort. You may luck out and run into a harem of elk making their way across an empty road. And you will, no doubt, be rather proud of your efforts, humble as they are.  If you do choose to make your own sea salt, use it as a finishing salt at the end of your preparation so that you can highlight its unique qualities. Desserts that call for fleur de sel would be perfect. As would any vegetable that does well with a simple pan fry, and I can think of no better vehicle than padron peppers. These little suckers are addictive. One in every ten or so is spicy, and that\u2019s part of the fun. The rest possess a mild green pepper flavor and are the perfect cocktail snack or small party appetizer.  This Padron Peppers with Sea Salt recipe is part of the  September Seasonal Food Guide

Above all, I\u2019m excited for the transition into autumnal foods: I can\u2019t deny that baked goods and soups and casseroles are looking mighty attractive right about now, and that I wouldn\u2019t mind a (little) break from salads. This may be the last crisp on here, at least for a long while. It\u2019s my go-to dessert, and I never tire of them, but there\u2019s something to be said for mixing it up a little, yes? This one celebrates all that is perfect about summer: it\u2019s a jammy mess of amazing fruit flavors and the kind of simple, unfussy cooking that leaves room for improvising and imperfection. The blackberries were gleaned from a sad-looking cluster of vines on a neglected street, and nothing brings me back to the summers of my childhood like the gathering of blackberries. Having grown up with the vines strangling every surface imaginable and a profusion of berries everywhere, it just doesn\u2019t feel right purchasing them at a market. They\u2019re never as good.  And in remembrance of today\u2019s significance, here\u2019s a  thoughtful piece from  On Being  that examines where we\u2019re at, ten years out, and does so with a great deal of grace.

V(Those are from my garden!) There is something uniquely compelling about listening to a story. Driving is perfect for this, especially when one has the luxury of piney hills and empty deserts on 75 MPH highways in rural America to drive through. Long walks and time spent cooking are also opportune moments for sneaking in some quality time with your favorite storytellers. Today, feeling just a touch nostalgic for those epic hours on the road, I thought I\u2019d share a list of some of my favorite podcasts.  1.  The Dinner Party Download : Currently holding title of personal favorite for their reliably funny broadcasts, weekly jokes, mixed drinks inspired by esoteric events from decades past, and weekly guests who are at typically engaging and insightful and often hilarious. Plus, they psychically picked up on the letter that I\u2019ve been writing to them in my head: they\u2019ve recently announced that they\u2019re expanding the show\u2019s length and scope and I couldn\u2019t be more happy about that.  2.  The Moth : Storytelling at its best. Live, frequently intense, often funny, compelling narrative. Without saying so, they are an exercise in gratitude.  It\u2019s remarkable how people can retain perspective and humor in the face of some pretty devastating stories.  3.  Radiolab  and  This American Life : The gold standards of radio narrative. Some personal favorites:  Limits . Totally riveting. The capabilities of the human body and mind are a bajillion times more than we realize and they do a darn fine job of driving that point home. If you ever feel like giving up and need a push, listen to this.  Break-up , for the interview with Phil Collins and Starlee Kine\u2019s endearing preoccupation with his music. If you haven\u2019t heard it, it\u2019s totally not what you\u2019d expect from an interview with Phil Collins. He\u2019s endearing and humble and strikingly honest.   4.  Re:Sound : Intriguing curation of audio clips across the radio and internet, culled into themes such as  boys vs. girls nomads , or  fathers 5.  Wait Wait \u2026 Don\u2019t Tell Me : They make me laugh out loud in embarrassingly inappropriate public places every week.  6.  Good Food : Evan Kleiman is a gem. The market report at the beginning of each broadcast is a great place to get inspired by creative, produce-driven recipes. But the whole show is a great service to anyone passionate about food and the issues around it. Jonathan Gold kills it every week with his wacky restaurant reviews.  What are your favorite podcasts, guys? Now, let\u2019s discuss this baked pasta. This is my kind of (secretly healthy) comfort food: lots of happily nuanced flavors lifting each other up, a lovely blend of three cheeses to keep things lively, a pile of just-soft-enough cherry tomatoes, and those darn fresh chickpeas. To understand the dramatic difference between a dried and a fresh chickpea, consider a fresh tomato and its sun-dried cousin. There\u2019s a relationship, but they\u2019re also rather strikingly different. The same is true of fresh chickpeas. They possess this fresh, green, nutty quality that a dried chickpea doesn\u2019t have. And I am kind of a jerk, because their season is nearing its end, and they\u2019re kind of hard to find. Look for them at farmers markets or middle eastern grocers.

VVinegar shrubs are just about the neatest thing ever. While there is apparently a long and noble tradition of diluting vinegar in water with a little honey for a refreshing drink, the shrub seems to have risen to popularity during temperance movements in the nineteenth century, when respectable ladies sought satisfying alternatives to strong drink.  There are many ways to go about making a shrub, but I opted to follow the wisdom of  Michael Dietsch on Serious Eats  and used the cold process. That is, rather than preparing a simple syrup by heating fruit, sugar and water together, I let the grapes macerate overnight in just sugar, then strained the next day and added vinegar. This preserves some of the subtle qualities of the uncooked fruit at its best. (But I won\u2019t tell if you choose to heat it \u2013 you\u2019ll bypass having to let it sit overnight this way.) Theirs called for equal parts sugar, fruit and vinegar. I scaled the sugar way back, and am happy that I did. It\u2019s still sweet, but not cloyingly so. Mixed with sparkling water (or sparkling wine, or vermouth, or vodka \u2013 limitless options!), you get yourself a fine effervescent beverage that\u2019s got the uniquely attractive sweet and sour pucker of both vinegar and fruit.

VTalking with my father on the phone last week, he wondered why the heck the structure and content of my blog was changing. He thought y\u2019all would want to know what was going on, too. Isn\u2019t that sweet? There\u2019s not too much change, really: I\u2019ve just created a schedule (Tuesday and Friday, every week!), and broadened the scope of what I produce. I\u2019ve done this to keep myself inspired, and it\u2019s working. I was by no means in a slump before, but now I feel extra enthusiastic. It is so awesome to have more focus: to bookmark interesting and inspiring stuff all over the internet throughout the week, and to deeply consider the nuance and tone of colors in produce. I kind of missed the structure that the Seasonal Food Guide provided, and now I have something new to anchor both myself and this place.  Although it is not spring, at all, something in this fresh start feels very springlike. It\u2019s influencing the food I make, too: there seems to be a penchant for bright, vibrant foods rather than the muted earth tones so common to slow-cooked winter meals. I\u2019m okay with that.  The preserved lemon is kind of amazing in this context. That and this simple parsley pesto bring the pasta to life. The chickpeas are first sauteed in a little olive oil and garlic, giving them a creamy interior and crisped exterior. Throw in some young spinach leaves and you\u2019re set. This is all kinds of easy goodness.

VI thought that I was pretty unbiased in my appreciation of vegetables. But I realized that I really just want to cook with cauliflower and brussels sprouts, again and again, every week. They are the first vegetables that come to mind no matter what new dish I am brainstorming. Rarely am I inspired by cabbage, beets, bell peppers, or eggplant.  So I\u2019ve been aiming to change my ways. Get out of my vegetable comfort zone and expand my gustatory horizon. And that\u2019s how we got here. I am pretty certain that I love eggplant in the right context \u2013 soft and spicy and stir-fried with basil at a Thai restaurant, or in eggplant parmesan, of course, that cheese-burdened but deeply delicious staple of childhood dinners at Italian restaurants. But it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve considered preparing it at home. And perhaps that is because I have failed with eggplant and that failure has resulted in a bitter dish that left a terrible feeling in the tummy. No wonder!  This time I was determined to have an eggplant win. I recalled the tangy miso dressing from  Bon Appetit\u2019s Food Lover\u2019s Cleanse  and had a suspicion that it would be a great ally atop some slow-roasted eggplant. And it was. So much so that I ate more of this in one sitting than I\u2019d like to admit. Salty, faintly sweet, with the smoky flavors of sesame oil and the bright pucker of rice vinegar and lime, it\u2019s the perfect foil for soft, creamy eggplant. Finish with fresh cilantro and some spicy togaroshi (a Japanese condiment of chili and sesame) and you\u2019ve got a hefty, gratifying dish.

VHere in San Francisco, we don\u2019t really get a summer. I do my best to keep mum about this, but it\u2019s kind of a weirdly overpowering phenomenon: while the rest of the country is in the thrall of muggy nights and the joys of popsicles and days at the beach, we are wrapped in our coats and scarves, raising our fists to the perennially grey sky in mute frustration. My point is, as much as I love summer foods, sometimes it feels weird to write about a salad when it\u2019s 59 degrees and foggy outside.  Autumn is the season that San Francisco does best. And that is probably because it spends the whole year practicing \u2013 where Los Angeles could be described as a nearly year-round summer, we are pretty much always in a state of autumn. Blame the tempering influence of the Pacific Ocean.  Now that it is September, and one day shy of the official start of fall, I can share all those soups that I secretly fantasized about on our chilly summer days. The beauty of this tomato soup is that it capitalizes on the peak of tomato season, which is very much happening in this corner of the world. Roasting them first sweetens and deepens the flavor. I used heirloom tomatoes, but that\u2019s not a requirement. Top with a large crouton and some fresh tarragon, and cozy up to the shorter days and golden light of autumn.

VSo it\u2019s about 94 degrees here and I\u2019ve just finished making meatballs, first roasting and then braising them in the simplest of tomato sauces. At the beginning of September, I began to contemplate all the foods that speak so perfectly of fall: braised meats, risottos and stews, winter squash, apples, pears . Cozy, slow-cooked, warming things. And of course we are hit with a whopper of a heat wave as soon as these cozy, cool weather menus have come to fruition in my mind, and lined themselves up to provide sustenance for the next month.  There\u2019s a lot of nuance to the old meatball. A lot of variation, a lot of opinion. But when you strip it to its essence, you\u2019re essentially finding a way to stretch a cut of meat. There are eggs and breadcrumbs to bind, parsley and basil and parmesan for depth of flavor, a dash of milk, enough salt to taste, and a tomato sauce made of little more than tomatoes. It\u2019s perfect.

VLast summer, I spent a few days camping with my friend Mikel and a crazy Frenchman he picked up in Austin named Dimitri. The crazy Frenchman prepared impressive meals for us nightly on a propane Coleman stove, taking frequent breaks to smoke cigarettes and drink cans of Budweiser. One night he made an interesting melange of rice with mayonnaise, tuna, canned green beans sauteed in garlic, and tomatoes. His ability to improvise with ingredients and make crappy food taste amazing was remarkable. He called the dish a classic French summer salad. (We may have furrowed our brows incredulously, but then, we were not raised in France.) I guess the point is that mayonnaise, olive oil, tuna and tomatoes work really well together. To boot, this is the easiest thing in the world to make. You prepare some pasta, throw all the  tonnato  ingredients in the processor, stir everything together, and you\u2019re set.   Tonnato  is a classic Italian sauce (from Piedmont) whose surprising underpinnings are tuna and mayonnaise. It is traditionally served on cold, sliced veal. We won\u2019t be doing that.

VGrowing up, we had a gorgeous persimmon tree in our backyard. It was a striking thing in fall, all those bright orange fruits hanging from spindly, nearly leafless branches. My mother would line persimmons from the tree along the window sill to let them soften until ripe. Try as I might, I could never get past their mushy, baby-food texture. That, of course, was not the fault of my mother \u2013 it was because we had the variety of persimmon that is not ripe for eating until the flesh is super soft. Then I discovered the Fuyu persimmon. They are firm when ripe and have a great, apple-like crunch to them. There is a lovely, subtly spicy quality to the fruit, vaguely like cinnamon, and because it is so sweet, it does really well when partnered with salty, savory or bitter flavors. This salad\u2019s got that in spades. For this recipe, I marinated the kale in lemon juice beforehand to soften the leaves \u2013 they retain a lot of that nice, chewy, raw quality but the lemon juice does a great job of tempering that just enough to make it more tender in its uncooked state. It\u2019s not a necessary step if you\u2019re short on time, but I think the salad really improves when prepped this way.

VWhen brussels sprouts first come into season, I could eat them almost daily, tossed with nothing more than olive oil, salt and pepper and pan-fried, and be happy for weeks. But when you have guests over, perhaps you want to jazz things up a little. There are so many satisfying choices where these crucifers are concerned \u2013 bacon, pecans, parmesan, lemon, balsamic vinegar \u2013 and you play mix and match with these in your head, and settle on a few. I love pan-roasting brussels sprouts because it is the least fussy method of preparation, and doing so caramelizes the leaves, which really makes this vegetable shine. And I discovered, totally by accident, that this is a case where crowding the pan is good. What happens is that because they are so packed together, they steam a little while browning and roasting, so they\u2019re both tender in the middle and golden crisp at the edge, which is exactly what you want.

aV Use the remains of an old baguette. Chop or break into pieces with a sharp knife. Process in the food processor until you have the texture of breadcrumb you desire. To toast them you can either use a toaster oven at 300 degrees until golden brown (this should only take a few minutes), or brown them in a pan. If using a pan, stir frequently so that they don\u2019t burn.\u000a

aVWarm a skillet over a medium flame. Melt the butter for a minute or two in the pan. When everything is nice and hot, add the brussels sprouts. Stir to coat them evenly with butter, then turn all of them so that the cut side is facing down. You will want to cook them for about twenty minutes, and as long as your heat is not too high, you will only need to stir them about three times. When you do stir them, turn down any that are facing up after stirring.\u000a
p6983
aVWhile the brussels sprouts are browning, mix together the breadcrumbs, parmesan, salt and pepper with a fork. Add the lemon zest last \u2013 it may clump a little, so break it up with the fork if necessary.\u000a

So, keep it in the fridge for up to two weeks, or freeze it for six months.

VIs it still risotto if you make it with brown rice? After having read something somewhere about blood sugar spiking after eating white rice, I decided that I would experiment with making a risotto employing brown, red, black, wild or any other kind of non-white rice. Mark Bittman gives the official okay to this practice in his tome  How to Cook Everything . Thanks Mark. And it worked. Using brown rice renders it a little more like pilaf and a little less like risotto, but it works, and that\u2019s the point. It tastes really good, rich and warming and cozy the way you want something to taste this time of year, and it\u2019s a little better for you. I can get behind that.  An important point about risotto:  you don\u2019t need to stir it constantly!  Sometimes in cooking, I like to find shortcuts. And I started doing this with risotto. And it\u2019s still lovely every time, as long as you stir it enough, so that the bottom of the pot doesn\u2019t burn.

p7099
aV: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut squash in half, place open side down in a glass baking dish, fill the dish with a little water, and roast until the squash is soft, about 40 minutes. It will most likely be soft enough that you don\u2019t need to puree it. Set the two cups for the risotto aside, and freeze the remainder. \u000a
p7100
aVIn a pot, warm the stock over low heat. You want it to be hot when adding to the rice. \u000a
p7101
aVWarm another, larger pot over medium-low heat. Saute the onions in the butter or oil until soft, about 5 minutes. \u000a
p7102
aVAdd the rice and the sage and rosemary and stir frequently until the rice becomes translucent around the edges, another 5 minutes or so. \u000a
p7103
aVAdd the wine. This is where you would begin the constant stirring. Instead, stir regularly but not constantly. \u000a
p7104
aVWhen the wine has been mostly absorbed, begin adding the stock, one cup at a time. Again, continue to stir at regular intervals, but don\u2019t be afraid to leave it alone for a bit. \u000a
p7105
aVIf you have added four cups of stock and find that the rice is still not cooked, add the fifth cup. \u000a
p7106
aVWhen the rice is cooked, add the parmesan and blend with the rice. Next, fold in the butternut squash and walnuts. Add salt and pepper to taste. \u000a

p7171
aVToss the torn bread in 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Place on a baking sheet and toast for about 10 minutes, so that they crisp up but are not quite as firm as a crouton. You can place the hazelnuts in here simultaneously, remembering to keep a close eye on them so that they don\u2019t burn.\u000a
p7172
aVMeanwhile, heat a skillet over a low flame. Add the onions, stirring frequently. When the onions have softened a little, add the garlic. Continue to stir frequently so that the garlic doesn\u2019t burn, until the onions are soft and translucent.\u000a

VAlthough we did not grow up eating chestnuts this time of year, there is something about their warm, woodsy smell when roasting that makes me incredibly nostalgic. Perhaps it is a very specific case of synesthesia, that phenomenon in which you confuse one sense for another, only I have confused those lyrics ( chestnuts roasting on an open fire , of course) for an actual ritual from my childhood.  Regardless of my mysterious attachment to them, they\u2019re a lovely treat. Decidedly un-nutty for something being called so, they are sweet and soft and delicate, dense in texture but yielding to the tooth.  Chestnuts are tasty eaten plain and hot from an oven or folded into an appetizer, pilaf or dessert.  Enjoy!

VLast week I spent a lot of time contemplating savory pie. I love how genius pie is, at its core: a flour and water package used as a means of containing a complete meal. Last week I also was reminded that I am not a talented pie baker. I had grand intentions to make some adorable mini turkey pies as a clever way of employing Thanksgiving leftovers. But part of what I enjoy most about cooking is the ability to improvise and experiment. As much as I tried to adhere to a recipe, I still failed. My dough was crumbly and stubborn, and it was heavy (two sticks of butter, egads!), and I nearly cried over the amount of labor involved for such a pitiful return. No more pies, not for a long time anyway. Well, no more pastry crust pie. Because there is that other, more quotidian, everyman arena of pie: the turnovers, pasties, calzoni and empanadas of the world. They are incredibly less fussy to make than a pastry crust, and a heck of a lot more fun.  Sprouted Kitchen  recently posted a marvelous recipe for  mini calzones , which provided the inspiration for this.  This version has been tailored for Thanksgiving and is easily adjusted to accommodate whatever leftover combination you desire. Go ahead and improvise: gravy, stuffing, cranberry relish or sweet potatoes would all be pretty darn good, I think, when stuffed in a little bread pocket such as this.

VI love cold and crisp fall days. (Who doesn\u2019t?) And I love this pumpkin bread, thanks to  Brooklyn Supper , one of my favorite food blogs. It\u2019s haunted me since I first made it. You may think that you\u2019ve had your fill of pumpkin, but this bread will change your mind about that. It strikes all the right notes \u2013 it\u2019s lighter and less sweet than most pumpkin breads, a welcome respite from the heavy treats that we\u2019ll no doubt gorge on over the next six weeks (read: healthier without being boringly so). And it\u2019s cozy and warming and makes your home smell wonderful. And then, there\u2019s this little surprise: a touch of ground black pepper that provides a tiny sharpness but is subtle enough so as to be hard to pin down.

VDecember is particularly celebratory for me because my birthday kicks off the season. Cozily couched between Thanksgiving and Christmas (and often coinciding with Hanukkah), it makes for a month of endless holiday partying \u2013 which means that I\u2019m often spent by the time NYE rolls around. But not yet! This weekend I\u2019ll be hosting a wintry birthday bash, and preparing lots of niblets for my friends to snack on.  Being enamored with chestnuts right now, I wanted to incorporate them into a simple hors d\u2019oeuvre and became really fixated on the idea of a spread. Their sweet flavor and starchy texture are balanced by the piquant creaminess of the goat cheese and the earthy qualities of the mushrooms. They\u2019re boosted by some fresh thyme and a splash of dry Sherry. And they\u2019re much healthier than traditional pate \u2013 something I doubt anyone will object to this time of year.

And because this Apple Molasses Bread (from  Eating Is Art ) is just the loveliest thing \u2013 it errs on the less-sweet side of the sugar spectrum, and with all of those bits of apple nestled into its soft crumb, it is somewhat wholesome too. The apples and applesauce keep it perfectly moist, and the molasses provides this fantastic, subtle complexity that rounds everything out nicely. Plus, molasses is good for you!

VMy dear grandmother, who is ninety-two, suggested that I post an entry about killing, cleaning and cooking turtles. She thinks it would be entertaining. And it would, no doubt \u2013 but turtle is not high on my list of exotic animals to eat, much less slaughter. She was raised on a farm in rural Tennessee, one of twelve children in a family that was definitely hand to mouth. And they ate things like that. They also ate squirrel, raccoon and possum, all of which she details in a lovely handmade book of old family recipes. It\u2019s a shame that I haven\u2019t posted any of her (tamer) recipes here \u2013 but let\u2019s consider this a promise to deliver on that in the near future.  Meanwhile, it is time, I think, to take a little respite from the decadence of the season with a dish that is hearty, warming, filling and nourishing. It\u2019s satisfying to eat something that feels deceptively like comfort food but is actually really, really good for you.  My friend Courtney had me over for supper last week and this is what she made for us. It was so good that I turned around and made it again this week. It\u2019s adapted from a recipe in  Mark Bittman\u2019s How to Cook Everything Vegetarian . Thanks Courtney and Mark!

VHere is a great technique for peeling squash gleaned from \u000a
p7595
aV101 Cookbooks:\u000a
p7596
aV Slice each end off the squash. Stand squash upright, and using a sharp vegetable peeler, slowly make your way down the length of the squash to peel the skin. Once peeled, slice the squash into one inch disks. Scoop out seeds with a spoon. Last, cube the squash into one inch pieces. \u000a
p7597
aVWarm a large, heavy bottomed pot over a medium flame. When hot, add the oil and allow it to heat. Add about half of the butternut squash \u2013 enough to fill but not crowd the bottom of the pan. Quickly toss them in the oil and then let them sit and develop a brown crust, about 5-7 minutes per side. When nicely browned, flip the squash and repeat.

VOur former neighbor and dear family friend, Liz, is renowned for the plates of cookies that she prepares annually at Christmas. As kids, my sister and I would fight over our favorites, and they would \u2013 reliably, mysteriously \u2013 disappear in the night time. Blame the straying fingers of elves or a hungry Santa Claus if you wish, or just the magical, irresistible power of her cookies. None of us live up there anymore, in the shady redwoods of the Santa Cruz mountains, and we miss her cookies terribly every year. So I decided to pay her a visit, to spend a lovely, rainy afternoon in her bright, cozy kitchen, catching up and learning a little bit about the magic that goes into these cookies. I made the drive south, through sprawling suburbs and then into the redwoods along the disarmingly curved Highway 17 through gossamer fog, forested hills and a light drizzle. It was heavenly. I don\u2019t think I can ever forget how to get back to that neighborhood, my very first and my favorite. It was amazing how much things had not changed \u2013 how that stretch of rural highway is still so surprisingly undeveloped, how so many of the old, funky houses are the same, and all those groves of redwoods and dilapidated buildings from a century ago still holding on. There\u2019s comfort in that, and there\u2019s comfort in these cookies too, with their dense, crunchy base composed largely of butter and brown sugar, and a lovely frosting of white chocolate and toasted nuts on the top. I had always thought that I didn\u2019t like white chocolate. And I also had no idea that these cookies were finished with them. So even if you think yourself averse, give it a try. It\u2019s surprising in its sweet subtlety here. Dark chocolate or milk chocolate would be fine substitutions, but they won\u2019t look as prettily like little jewels made in some magical winter wonderland if you forgo the white chocolate. Your call!

VThe New York Times\u2019 recent holiday cocktail spread featured a drink,  The Bohemian Spritz , that they described as  compellingly arboreal . I would like to imbibe something compellingly arboreal this time of year, standing next to a sprightly evergreen tree, or near a fire, or in a chalet. Sadly, the most compellingly arboreal ingredient, pine liqueur, is not the kind of thing one can pick up on an afternoon of errands around town. It is the kind of thing for which one pays a pretty penny to have sent straight from a remote mountaintop distillery in Switzerland or Austria.  Having a decidedly alpine agenda last week, one involving herbs, citrus, bitters and sparkling wine, I was not going to let obscure ingredients get in the way of success. It is said that spritzes were popularized in Italy during Austrian occupation. Interested in abiding by this Austro-Italian hybrid (and part homage to the Danube Spritz at  Diner  in Brooklyn, one of my favorites) I came up with the Tyrolean Spritz.  The basic formula for a spritz is simple: sparkling wine, sparkling water and some kind of bitter aperitif (but digestifs work equally well.) Most often you will find your spritz with Aperol. But the family of bitter aperitifs and digestifs is large and there is a lot of room for experimentation. I landed on Ramazzotti Amaro, which is milder and sweeter than many aperitifs. Boosted by a few dashes of orange bitters, rosemary simple syrup and some fresh orange, it is perfect drinking at the holidays: amber-hued but light on the palate, festive and sparkly with pleasant herbal and citrus undertones.  Happy quaffing!

VWhen I first moved to San Francisco I was a frequent patron of Rainbow Grocery. And they have this lovely pastry section, which is where I discovered rugelach. I also discovered that it was nearly impossible to resist these buttery little confections, and would leave having compulsively purchased one or three. Fortunately I have been able to curtail that habit now that I am a mature grown-up and am able to exercise restraint.  However, eaten in moderation, and prepared so that they\u2019re extra small, rugelach are, perhaps, one of the best cookies out there. My goodness. That remarkable butter and cream cheese combo really makes for a magical, flaky pastry that tastes ridiculous. And I especially love pecan, cinnamon and brown sugar together, perhaps because it is vaguely reminiscent of the cinnamon toast of my youth. But these cookies are flexible so far as a filling is concerned \u2013 you can mix it up by incorporating jams, fruit butters or chocolate instead.

Spread a layer of the topping across the dough, leaving the far edge of the dough untopped. Carefully roll into a log. Dust with brown sugar and cinnamon, pressing them gently into the dough. Slice into half-inch or inch-wide discs, depending on the size of the cookie you\u2019d like. Place cookies on a greased baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough. \u000a

VWhen I first moved to San Francisco I was a frequent patron of Rainbow Grocery.
p7851
aVAnd they have this lovely pastry section, which is where I discovered rugelach.
p7852
aVI also discovered that it was nearly impossible to resist these buttery little confections, and would leave having compulsively purchased one or three.
p7853
aVFortunately I have been able to curtail that habit now that I am a mature grown-up and am able to exercise restraint.
p7854
aVHowever, eaten in moderation, and prepared so that they\u2019re extra small, rugelach are, perhaps, one of the best cookies out there.

VThat delicate little spoon above is from my grandmother\u2019s collection of silver, the kind of stuff that\u2019s brought out only once a year. And that\u2019s my step-mom\u2019s beautifully patinaed All-Clad pot. And the stew that we supped on the night of Christmas Eve, whose simplicity and ease is remarkable. It\u2019s just fish, fish stock, tomatoes, wine and spices. It\u2019s all you need. We seem to have unofficially adopted a seafood-themed dinner the night before Christmas, and it\u2019s a tradition that I enjoy. But by no means should this fantastic soup be limited to holiday dinners. It\u2019s perfect when reheated the night after, when you\u2019re tired and cold and not in the mood to cook, when you want to feel indulgent without calling upon heavy cream or butter.

VOne of my favorite things about December in California is the proliferation of fresh oranges (and all citrus, really). I love them in their simplest form, eaten by hand in sections, but placing a whole slice of orange on a piece of toast is a little awkward. And as popular and exotic a gift as they were in Victorian stockings (a tradition my father continued), giving a person an orange is sadly not a very special thing anymore. Instead, you give them marmalade. I love marmalade because it\u2019s fun to say. And because I have a fondness for things with competing flavors: here, the sweet and the bitter. And because there\u2019s something fascinating about seeing pieces of orange rind suspended in an orange jelly. This was my first time making marmalade and there were some panicky moments. Most recipes call for supreming, or sectioning, the fruit and reserving the pith and seeds for their pectin. This took a lot of extra work, and a lot of the fruit was lost in the supreming, and my jam had not set after more than an hour following this method, so I gave up and added pectin. I don\u2019t think that supreming is necessary, and to err on the safe side, let\u2019s just use pectin! There is one fussy step that is sort of unavoidable: peeling and julienning the rind of the orange. If you aren\u2019t concerned about how those little bits of suspended orange rind look in their lovely glass jars, just do a fine chop. The recipe below accounts for my amendments, and will hopefully be a breeze to follow. Please email or comment with any questions! And enjoy your marmalade.

VPut a small plate in the freezer \u2013 you\u2019ll use this later to test whether the jam has set.\u000a
p7960
aVThoroughly wash and scrub your fruits.\u000a
p7961
aVUsing a sharp vegetable peeler, carefully peel the rind from the oranges and lemons in long strips.\u000a
p7962
aVWorking with 4-5 strips of stacked rind at a time, julienne with a sharp knife. (Or just do a fine chop if you don\u2019t care how the rind looks in the finished jam.)\u000a
p7963
aVAdd the rind and the 4 cups water to a large, non-reactive pot. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes, covered.\u000a
p7964
aVWhile the rind simmers, slice the tops and bottoms off your fruit, and then slice the remaining peel from them.\u000a
p7965
aVWorking over a glass bowl so that you catch all of that lovely juice, slice the orange in thirds horizontally. Remove the inner white pith and discard. Break the orange and lemon into small bits. Mash with your fingers or a wooden spoon. Squeeze any juice out of the peel if there is any pulp attached.\u000a
p7966
aVIn a medium bowl, combine the pectin with 2 cups of the sugar. Set aside.\u000a
p7967
aVWhen the rind is thoroughly simmered, add the chopped fruit and reserved juices. If using Pomona pectin, add the calcium water now. Cover, and bring to a low boil, stirring every few minutes.\u000a
p7968
aVWhile the jam is bubbling, bring a large stock pot to a boil and sterilize your jars, gummed lids and rings. Sterilize them in boiling water for at least 15 minutes. When done, turn off heat but leave them in the hot water.\u000a
p7969
aVOne the jam has been simmering for about one hour, add the sugar/pectin mix and stir thoroughly for about a minute. Then add the remaining sugar and stir again. At this time, do the set test: place a small dollop of jam on the cold plate, let sit for about a minute.  Press gently \u2013 if it wrinkles, it is most likely set. If not, add more pectin.\u000a
p7970
aVReturn the jam to boil, then remove from heat.\u000a
p7971
aVTake jars from their water bath and place next to your marmalade.\u000a
p7972
aVUsing a 1/4 cup measure (it\u2019s a good size for scooping) and a wide-mouthed funnel, ladle hot jam into jars. Fill to 1/4 inch from top of jar. Wipe the lids and any spilled jam from the side of the jars, and apply the gummy seals and rings.\u000a
p7973
aVReturn the jars to the stock pot used for sterilizing and process them in a hot water bath. You\u2019ll want to time it so that they process for 5 minutes from when the water begins to boil.\u000a
p7974
aVUsing jar grabber, heavy oven mitts or a thick towel, remove from heat and arrange jars in a spot where they can sit undisturbed overnight. Once cool, check seals by pressing at the center of the lid. If there is no movement, it has been properly sealed.\u000a
