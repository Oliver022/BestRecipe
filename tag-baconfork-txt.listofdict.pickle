VThe boyfriend and I spent the greater part of the weekend indulging in House of Cards. We just can\u2019t get enough. We only have a few more episodes of season 2 left to watch and now the feeling of sadness and regret begin to sink in, wishing we had taken our time a little more to savor each episode. It\u2019s okay though because it was really great just being a boob on Saturday with my guy. So I\u2019m really excited about our post today because it\u2019s dehydrated citrus wheels! I love when winter rolls around and we\u2019re able to enjoy all the fun seasonal citrus. I specifically get really excited for tangerines, blood oranges and Meyer lemons. Although the process can be a little tedious because of the time, dehydrating citrus wheels such an easy thing to do with beautiful results and lots of great uses. You can use your dehydrated citrus wheels to flavor a simple hot tea, chopped up and added to soups/stews, pureed into a powder and mixed with herbs and spices to create a custom rub for meats and seafood, or you can even mix it with other whole spices like cinnamon sticks and star anise for a fragrant and homemade potpourri. If you\u2019re having a boob-ish sort of day then why not put on a marathon on your favorite show while dehydrating some citrus? It\u2019s so easy and your entire place will smell sweet and delicious for hours! Enjoy! xx, Jenny DIY: Dehydrated Citrus Wheels

VERMAHGERD! Yes. I have fallen into the internets dark endless hole of memes. This particular type of meme, the  ermahgerd meme  has earned itself a new Teri voice. A voice I didn\u2019t even know I had in me. Let me explain, to those of you that have animals you probably have an \u2018talk to you animal voice.\u2019 I totally have one, its pretty good, and really annoying. Jenny has one, her voice is so high and quite though, humans can definitely not hear it as well as her dog. My friend Adrianna\u2019s animals voice is louder than mine, and she gives animals attitudes. My voice is like a 5 year old boy talking. My new ermahgerd meme voice is like me talking with braces when I had my bands on. If you don\u2019t know what bands are, you\u2019re lucky. They are rubber bands you attach to the metal of your teeth, and it makes it hard to open your mouth. People often think you have gum stuck in your teeth. Anyway, I\u2019m really excited about my new meme voice. Sometimes, it\u2019s so fun to be really annoying. In honor of my new voice, I am going to ermahgerd you with a new fall soup recipe for your repertoire. This is a silky and smooth perfectly fall soup right down to the color. See those little balls in there? Those are rice balls. Basically this soup already comes with a far superior version of saltines. I love more than anything to put saltines in my soup, but the fact this soup has rice balls in it, makes it the one and only soup that doesn\u2019t need that salty addition. Its ermahgerd! good. \u2665 Teri Korean Kabocha Squash Porridge Serves 4 to 6

VRisotto is one of my favorite foods. EVER. I love it so much because it\u2019s so easy to make and you can add all kinds of things to it. Getting into the spirit of fall, while trying to ignore this totally non-fall weather we\u2019ve been experiencing in L.A. (BOO!) lately, I decided to make some pumpkin risotto. I love pumpkin almost as much as I love risotto\u2026.almost. To me pumpkin is something that\u2019s completely underrated. Sure, there\u2019s pumpkin spice lattes (totally yum) and pumpkin pie (again, yum), but there\u2019s so much you can do with pumpkin that I want to see done more often, like maybe pumpkin ale beer brats?\u2026roasted pumpkin hummus?\u2026.or even baked pumpkin chips?! Today we\u2019re sticking with pumpkin risotto and topping it off with seared scallops(light and sweet to compliment the pumpkin flavor) and a confetti of candied pancetta (because confetti is fun and candied pancetta is awesome). You can save time on this already simple dish by making the pumpkin puree mixture a day or two a head of time. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious you can go ahead and roast your own pumpkin instead of using canned, but I think canned pumpkin puree works just fine, plus it saves mucho time. Okay, enjoy! xx Jenny Pumpkin Risotto with Seared Scallops Serves 6

VIt was 90 degrees yesterday. I am convinced that not having air conditioning is a survival of the fittest situation, and if you do not have one, you die. Mix 90 degree weather with a leather couch, and a hot computer on your lap and you have a mess. My gross legs stuck to my couch to the point where I knew getting up would be painful. Also, I think I have done permanent skin damage to the part of my legs where my laptop sits. I do not think they will ever look the same. EVER. Other than that, this weekend was fun. I spent time thinking how my favorite  actor  as a child was either super creepy or super hilarious. I went to a party where too many people were wearing what appeared to be mini versions of top hats (is this a new trend? It should stop immediately.) I could be mistaken, it was dark. I also found out how much prosecco is too much. Overall a great weekend. How was yours? Now, on to food. Artichokes are one of my favorites. They are soooo pretty. Like a nice mid century design, and a great color. We have three artichoke recipes this week. All of which are super gorgeous. This Artichoke Sun-Dried Tomato & Goat Cheese Pasta recipe is great because its a lighter pasta dish. A dish where you don\u2019t have to un button the top of your pants when you are done. \u2665 Teri Artichoke Sun-Dried Tomato & Goat Cheese Pasta Serves 4 to 5

VI\u2019ve watched the entire first season of Homeland now. I can\u2019t really tell if I like the show, or if I just like seeing Claire Danes\u2019 cry face. I have always loved Claire Danes, since the days of My So Called Life, but man, does she have one of the ugliest/amazing cry faces ever. She is so good at her cry face it makes me depressed, because I become sad with her. So, being obsessed with cry faces, obviously I googled \u201cClaire Danes cry face.\u201d What would come up but a wonderful  tumblr FULL of cry faces . It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s everything you would want it to be. There are some real gems in there, especially some of Kim Kardashian. Amazing. Do you guys have a favorite cry face? Please share, I would love to see. Ok, moving on from cry faces and onto muffins. Most of the time, I am not really a huge muffin fan. I can attribute this to my parents\u2019 obsession with Costco and the flats of muffins they would buy for the house. These muffins were the size of my face, and a flat consisted of chocolate chip, blueberry, and poppy seed. If I wanted a snack, it was \u201cEat a muffin.\u201d I became over muffins. Quickly. It wasn\u2019t until my late twenties that I explored the muffin world again. Still though, I am only really interested in muffins that don\u2019t cross over the flavor types of muffins in my past. Therefore, I love these muffins. Perfect bits of fall in every bite. Perfect, cozy, pretty, drink coffee and read a book muffins. Dig in. \u2665 Teri Streuseled Acorn Squash Muffins Makes 24

VEvery holiday season it seems like butternut squash (yum!) and pumpkin (yum!) take over and all other squash go by unnoticed or grossly under-appreciated. So this year we wanted to give a small shout out to some other amazing types of squash we love so much. Acorn squash is up there with one of my favorites. I love it because it has a sweet flesh similar to butternut, but it\u2019s not as nutty; plus the sweet notes are more subtle than butternut squash. This recipe is really easy and something I make often during this time of yr because it\u2019s easy, filling and I can eat it as a snack or turn it into a  meal by dicing it up and adding it to some quinoa, couscous, etc. Another awesome thing to do with this squash is to slice the top off, scoop out the seeds, fill it up with some sort of fruit n\u2019 nut spiced rice or a savory meat mixture OR even chopped nuts and bleu cheese (okay, I\u2019ll stop), pop the top back on and roast it! If you\u2019re not convinced that acorn squash is all that delicious then at least love it for the fact that it\u2019s called \u201cacorn squash\u201d because it looks like a big acorn\u2026now that\u2019s just cute. xx Jenny Maple Glazed Roasted Acorn Squash Serves 4 to 6

VHi All! Did everyone have a good weekend? Anyone do anything fun? I had a partial work weekend and a partial relax.eatgoodfood.nap.readagoodbook weekend. I haven\u2019t picked up a book in almost a year (so embarrassing, yes), so I decided it was finally time to say goodbye to the basketball wives, peace out Bethanny and hope to never see you again, you crazy ladies from New Jersey! Ahhh! It feels good to be free :) I\u2019ve started reading  Haunted  by one of my favorite authors, Chuck Palahniuk (author of Fight Club, Stranger Than Fiction, Choke, Invisible Monster, Rant, etc etc\u2026.love this guy). His books are really easy reads and my favorite thing about them is that they\u2019re SOOOO twisted, bizarre, weird, creepy, and totally awesome. If you\u2019re only familiar with Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s  Fight Club  and enjoyed it, I\u2019m here to tell you\u2026TIP OF THE ICEBERG!  He\u2019s like the next Stephen King, but instead of creepy clown monsters, demons and prisoners he write about rabid humans, vengeful transvestites and survival of the fittest/most desperate.  You know, the usual stuff. Anyway, onto food. This week we\u2019re trying a little something new\u20261 Recipe: 3 Ways! This means that we\u2019re going to be taking 1 basic recipe and  showing you how to transform it into 3 different, awesome recipes throughout the week. We\u2019re starting this new section with,  basic pizza dough.  I feel like a good solid pizza dough is something everyone should know how to make or at least have a recipe for, on file at home. Once you have the dough down, you can go to town and make a bunch of different things; you can create a pizza with toppings you love, you can make calzones, you can make focaccia, etc. Today we\u2019re starting you all off with the basic pizza dough recipe (so good!) and one of my favorite pizzas. EVER. It\u2019s a simple thin, cornmeal crusted pizza topped with melted fontina, salty prosciutto, sweet caramelized butternut squash, caramelized red onions, and crispy kale. The combo of these ingredients made into a pizza\u2026pure bliss! Really. What are some of your favorite pizza toppings??Enjoy! xx Jenny Prosciutto Kale & Butternut Squash Pizza Makes 2 pizzas

Some peoples are first pumps in the air, and some people have a simple one finger wiggle dance. I bring this up because I totally did my dance when I ate this Open Faced Italian Fig Sandwich.

VI had this drink for the first time 7 years ago in Salvador, Brazil. A capiroska is pretty much caipirinha\u2019s less popular little sister. They\u2019re practically the same drink except a caipirinha is made with cachaca and a capiroska is made with vodka. Now normally even the idea of vodka would make me want to vom (just not a fan), but you can make this drink quite strong without the usual \u201crubbing alcohol\u201d throat burn. When I ordered the drink I had no idea what I was ordering since the entire menu was in Portuguese, a language I sadly do not speak except for the word \u201ckiwi\u201d. I thought to myself, \u201cEh, I like kiwi\u2019s, why not.\u201d Little did I know I was about to discover my drink of choice for the remainder of my month stay in Brazil. I was a little bummed when my drink didn\u2019t come in a big, shiny coconut like every other persons drink at my table\u2026.just a tall, clear glass filled with clear liquid and muddled kiwis. I took one sip and my coconut envy disappeared immediately! Not only could I not taste the abrasive flavor of vodka (sorry vodka fans!), but it was also only subtly sweet and not overly syrupy. I was pretty much in heaven! Not to mention I was munching on spicy shrimp filled acaraje (black-eyed pea fritters), and surrounded by a diverse group of fascinating people, so I really couldn\u2019t be happier! I\u2019ve since made my own version a number of times, altering amounts of this and that along the way, and this recipe is the closest I could get to bring me back to my amazing stay in the beautiful and culturally thriving country of Brazil. This drink is so wonderful year round, light and refreshing! Enjoy! xx Jenny Kiwi Capiroska Makes 6

VHi hi hi! It\u2019s been one of those weeks for me where you run around and wake up in the middle of the night with thoughts of things to do and things to buy. I just moved into a new studio that is super awesome, and it makes me feel important. I will post pictures soon. The new studio is where all the new SFB action (photo and food styling) will take place. I bought weird hanging upside down air plants from fab.com, and other random stuff for the studio so it looks cute, because that\u2019s super important. If you don\u2019t know about fab.com, do yourself a favor and never know. They are totally stealing all my money. They have cool things over there. I have also bought two cat beds from them already. Its an issue. I am having Thanksgiving in the studio this year, utilizing a lot of  the amazing recipes from this  here blog! Its just me and a bunch of friends. We are going to put up a badminton situation in the shooting space, mainly so I can re-live high my school tennis playing days and try to hit people in the face with the shuttle cock (this is what that ball thing you play badminton with is called, weird right?). I mean this hitting people in the face thing in the best most loving way possible\u2026 really. Before the whole Thanksgiving thing starts, I plan to sit on the couch admiring my new cat beds, and eat this soup with fuzzy socks on, and lose fitting clothing. \u2665 Teri Curried Butternut Squash Soup Serves 4 to 6

aV4. Allow the squash to cool for 15 minute before scooping the flesh into a bowl. Discard the skin.\u000a
p791
aV5. Heat oil in saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté for 5 minutes.\u000a
p792
aV6. Add thyme and chives and sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p793
aV7. Add curry powder, cumin, cinnamon, and squash and stir until just combined.\u000a
p794
aV8. Pour the broth over the mixture and stir. Simmer soup for 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a

VHi Guys! Today we have the first post for our Recipe Redressed series! In this series, we\u2019re going to be taking some of our favorite, everyday comfort foods, \u2018redress\u2019 them (get it?), then give you guys one new version everyday for the whole week! We\u2019re starting out with grilled cheese to celebrate national Grilled Cheese month! and yes folks, grilled cheese month is a real thing! You\u2019ll notice this week that our recipes will just have ingredient lists without amounts because we don\u2019t want to tell anyone how much of each thing to put into their grilled cheese sandwich, it\u2019s such a personal thing and we get that. You\u2019ll also notice that all the recipes call for shredded cheese. We love using freshly shredded cheese in our grilled cheeses because it helps melt the cheese faster and more evenly. We\u2019re starting our week off with one of our favorites and of course it has a little ( or a lot) of crisp and delicious bacon in it! We love the crunch of the sweet apples against the salty bacon and used cheddar because apple and cheddar are like two peas in a pod\u2026they go incredibly well together! Anyway, we hope you guys will stick around for the week as we share some of our favorite grilled cheese recipes. Enjoy! Bacon Apple Cheddar Grilled Cheese

p846
aV1. Slather both sides of each slice of bread with butter.\u000a

VI turned 30 last Friday. What a weird experience that was. I don\u2019t really do much for my birthdays because honestly, they are not that big of deal to me. This one for some reason was different. When you\u2019re little, or a teen in junior high you have all these high hopes for where you will be when you\u2019re 30, successful, with a huge house, cool friends, exercising, and generally being weird. When you get to 30 and some of those dreams are not real yet it\u2019s a strange feeling. It\u2019s not like I have accomplished nothing, or that I feel like I have let myself down in anyway, it\u2019s more like \u201cWow, life moves fast, and it\u2019s kinda scary.\u201d In the week leading up to my 30th I had lots of mini melt down, and a couple of bigger ones. Most involved crying, and some involved sobbing for no reason. I was totally weirdly emotional. Yuck. Luckily, all my friends who are in their 30\u2019s were telling me how much better the 30\u2019s are than your 20\u2019s. So I do feel a lot better. I also feel a renewed sense of ambition to do things, lots of things, different things. Kind of exciting! I wonder how you all felt when you turned 30? Some of you probably have seen from our Instagram that one of us is in Tokyo. That\u2019s me! I\u2019m there! Eating sushi and ramen and gaining a million pounds. This is my birthday trip! Follow along! \u263a To cheers to my 30th can we all just please eat some meatballs? Meatballs are one of my favorite food groups. You can eat them as an appetizer, put them on a pasta, or put them in a huge sandwich, which is my preferred way of consumption. These meatballs are a little spicy and a lot delicious. Another way I will totally eat these are cold, like left over pizza the next day, still delicious. Is that gross? I hope not. Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Ginger-Garlic Cocktail Meatballs Makes 24 to 28

VHow to become un-single: Just kidding. I have no idea how to become un-single. Unless being un-single means painting your nails on a Saturday night with Harry Potter on and cuddling with your cat. Then I\u2019ve got that shiz figured out. Anyway, if you\u2019re single too, you probably fantasize about making cute things for the boy or girl in your life in the morning when the start of your exciting new relationship is blossoming. I do too. It\u2019s ok. So here we have a large adult pop tart. Isn\u2019t this freaking cute? Yes, yes it is. So here is where the fantasy part takes over. You wake up, fresh faced and beautiful. You just  happen  to have all the ingredients to whip up this awesome breakfast pastry. What a coincidence (must tell you, it took major restraint to not write ccoinkydink). So you make this Fruit & Rum Almond Pastry, and then sit with your cups of coffee, staring into each others eyes while the smell of freshly baked goodness intermingles with your pheromones and wafts up into both your faces. How can this scenario be made better? I dunno. I think this is it. So make this pastry, and then tell me how it worked out. Good luck. \u2665 Teri Fruit & Rum Almond Pastry Serves 4-6

VDirections:\u000a
p990
aV1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.\u000a
p991
aV2. Place the dried apricots and rum in a small bowl and toss together.\u000a
p992
aV3. Allow the mixture to soak for about 30 minutes to an hour (depending on the depth of rum flavor desired).\u000a
p993
aV4. Strain the dried apricots and place in a heavy saucepan with the marmalade, sugar, orange juice, wine, and water. Stir.\u000a
p994
aV5. Simmer over medium-low heat for 35-40 minutes or until the dried apricots soften and the mixture has become thick and syrupy, stirring often.\u000a
p995
aV6. Add the fresh apricots and continue to simmer for about 10 minutes, mashing and stirring often.\u000a
p996
aV7. Pour the mixture into a heatproof bowl and fold in the almonds and almond extract. Set aside and allow to cool.\u000a
p997
aV8. Once the filling has cooled roll each of the packaged pie dough sheets into a 11\u201dx 6\u201drectangle, using a small amount of flour to prevent sticking.\u000a
p998
aV9. Spread the filling evenly over one of the rectangles, leaving a ½ in border around the dough.\u000a
p999
aV10. Brush the edge of the dough with the beaten egg yolk and place the other rectangle over the filling and dough.\u000a
p1000
aV11. Using a fork crimp the edges together to create a seal around the pastry and place the entire pastry onto a parchment lined baking sheet.\u000a
p1001
aV12. Cut 5 diagonal slits through the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape.\u000a
p1002
aV13. Bake the pastry for about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the top with cream.\u000a
p1003
aV14. Place the pastry back into the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until golden brown.\u000a
p1004
aV15. Remove the pastry from the oven and place onto a cooling rack.\u000a
p1005
aV16. While the pastry cools place the powdered sugar, cream and vanilla in a small bowl and stir together, making sure not to whisk, but to stir to prevent air bubbles.\u000a
p1006
aV17. Once the pastry has cooled drizzle the icing over the pastry and sprinkle with the toasted almonds. Cut and serve.\u000a

I really like single serving pastries because then its SUPER clear whats mine, and super clear what is yours, and you won\u2019t be eating any of mine. It prevents a hog situation from arising, yet still satisfies everyone. So apart from that, they are also super cute. Its like a puppy with huge paws, or a baby giraffe that stands crooked. Mini stuff is always cute and always awesome. This would be a great thing to bring to a BBQ. Cherry Hand Pies Makes 12

VI had this amazing dish for the first time about a year ago from this unsuspecting place that seemed to be in the middle of nowhere,  Cafe Hiro . Being a HUGE uni (sea urchin) fan myself I was so excited to see something like this on the menu. This isn\u2019t just a dish for people who love the umami goodness of uni. My boyfriend, who normally gags at the sight of the stuff, was LOVING it! The subtle sweetness combined with hints of fresh ocean salt\u2026.SO GOOD. I\u2019ve made my own version of this dish many times since, because it\u2019s just that good. I know, I know, you get it so I\u2019ll stop now. Enjoy! xx Jenny Uni Spaghetti Serves 3 to 4

VIt was one of those days where you feel fat and think that everyone sucks. I was picking up a friend from the airport, and she was trying to convince me to go and eat with her at the Grove Farmers Market. I did NOT feel like doing this at all. It was a day when everything and everyone is annoying and I just wanted to go home and watch Harry Potter and be a nerd on the computer and not talk to anyone. I was beginning to think people were generally bad, and have no manners. I was just kinda down. Do you ever have these days?  I was finally able to be convinced to go eat. We drove into the parking lot of the farmers market, I found a spot, put my signal on and waited for them to back out. They did, and then BAM, my spot got swiped. HELLO! MY SIGNAL WAS ON! So that was annoying. AND RUDE. I also got called a mean name by a lady because I had no money to give her. This was both shocking and hilarious. Anyway, we make our way into the farmers market. Its an interesting place. Its filled with both good food, bad food, touristy crap, hot sauce, boba, stickers, cowboy hats, candy, and pretty much anything else you can think of. Its a weird spot.  Loteria Grill  is one of those good food places. Like I mentioned before, I was having a fat day, so these tacos were perfect. Vegetarian, light, and fracking delicious. Seriously. Get this, and get the limeaid. This place also has a lot of other delicious items, but I swear by these tacos, and only really get them when I eat here. You will find our interpretation of this recipe below. Perfect for summer, and fat days. Okay, so the moral of the story. If you\u2019re having a bad day, and think people are generally bad, you will inevitably dwell on things that make people bad, as opposed to not paying attention to it like you would any other day. Its like a trap. So if you\u2019re having a negative Nancy kinda day, try to get a little perspective and power through it. Also, if you\u2019re having a fat day, make these tacos. Also, if someone does a favor for you, no matter how small, make sure you say thank you. Manners are nice and appreciated. \u2665 Teri Grilled Zucchini Tacos Serves 4 to 5

VHi Guys! Today we have what we think is our best ever, marinara sauce! It\u2019s so simple and delicious and only requires a few ingredients. One thing that makes our basic marinara sauce so awesome is that we use  Troublemaker wine , by Hope Family Wines in Paso Robles, California. This wine is great because it\u2019s a blend of multiple types of red including: Syrah, Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Syrah and Zinfandel. The multi-vintage blend makes for a rich and bold wine that is fruit forward with notes of black cherries, raspberries and vanilla. It has a slightly smoky and black pepper finish to it that pleasantly lingers in the mouth. It\u2019s a wonderful wine to use for cooking as well and I love it in our marinara sauce. It adds an element of depth to the deliciously simple sauce. We also use marjoram in our sauce, instead of the typical oregano. I love the scent and flavor of marjoram and I like to call it the cousin of oregano. It has a mild, sweet pine and citrus flavor, that doesn\u2019t overpower the tomatoes. This marinara sauce is so simple to make and you can seriously pour this stuff on anything! I love using it in my lasagnas, as a base for a complex red sauce and even as a dipping sauce for garlic bread, fried ravioli and more! Stay tuned to see what we decide to do with this yummy marinara sauce, this Friday! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Marinara Sauce Makes 3 to 4 cups

VHi All! In honor of the final HP movie Teri and I thought it would be fun to create recipes around our favorite HP characters (totally nerdy, yet totally awesome). I know, I know. We\u2019re late. Forgive us. Last week Teri wrote about her favorite character, Luna Lovegood. When Teri asked me to write a recipe for \u201cLuna\u2019s Pudding\u201d I was excited! When she told me she wanted a recipe to make enough pudding to fill a large trifle I thought to myself, \u201cHm\u2026that\u2019s weird\u201d\u2026.but that\u2019s Teri, so very wonderfully weird :) Now on my end, I don\u2019t think I would say Ron is necessarily my favorite character in the whole movie, but a do appreciate his insatiable appetite. This guy can really eat and it makes me happy because food makes me happy! Yes, it\u2019s as simple as that.  So in honor of the final HP film I decided to create, what I thought to be the most appropriate recipe I could think of inspired by Mr Ron Weasley:  Everything but the Kitchen Sink Pies.  Why a meat pie? Because to me: savory pies > sweet pies.  Enjoy! xx Jenny Ron Weasley\u2019s Eveything But The Kitchen Sink Pie Makes 6

VLuna Lovegood is by far my favorite Harry Potter character. Those weird glasses she wears that lets her see things, her cravings for pudding, just her all around weirdness I enjoy. She is by far the best Harry Potter character. I don\u2019t care what you say. Also, yes, I watch Harry Potter. No, I\u2019m not ashamed. They are good movies, reeeeaaaaally good movies. Its a bit of a love affair situation I have going on. I got hooked on these movies and watch them over and over. I think its because they are so visually intense and inspiring. Each time I watch them I find something new, something I didn\u2019t see before that sparks excitement and a creative mojo that can only be described as epic. Sometimes its color combinations, sometimes its compositions. It doesn\u2019t matter really, what matters is that I (and probably many others) are creatively inspired. Ok, maybe the story line in the movies isn\u2019t the most amazing, and there are other things I could point out as well. But all that doesn\u2019t matter to me. Its the costumes, the fracking ah-mazing set design, the hair and make up, that is what I love, that is why I keep coming back for more. ANYWAY. Luna loves pudding and so do I. So here is a Luna Lovegood inspired recipe for you. \u2665 Teri Luna Lovegood\u2019s Pudding Makes 1  8inch trifle

VSo remember how I\u2019ve told you guys before that I don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth? Well, it\u2019s true. I\u2019ll choose scrambled eggs and bacon over a pastry or muffin any day, I\u2019d rather  indulge on a cheese plate than a sweet treat after dinner, and it would never cross my mind to grab something like a handful of cookies when I want to refuel \u2026..just a handful of  Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos  and I\u2019m good, thankyouverymuch! Jordan (my boyfriend) on the other hand is the exact opposite. If we\u2019re at home, by the time our dinner dishes land in the sink his head is in the freezer to see if we have ice cream or he has car keys in hand, ready for a fro-yo date\u2026.him and the frozen yogurt, that is. While he\u2019s a lover of all sweets, his favorite is definitely ice cream\u2026\u2026with whipped cream\u2026\u2026and caramel sauce\u2026.with maybe an Oreo or two crumbled on top yea, he takes dessert time pretty seriously. I like to think that this ice cream is the perfect dessert for a couple trying to satisfy both a sweet and a salt tooth.  Salted caramel is something I\u2019m actually kind of into and in ice cream form it\u2019s kind of amazing. Why candied bacon?\u2026.why not?\u2026right?! Sweet and salty combos are awesome and this one in particular is like  died and gone to heaven  awesome :) I stuck it in between graham crackers for the photo above, but it\u2019s just as good on it\u2019s own\u2026.or sandwiched between Ritz crackers\u2026no really, it is! Try it! xx Jenny Salted Caramel and Candied Bacon Ice Cream Makes 1 quart

VI\u2019ll choose scrambled eggs and bacon over a pastry or muffin any day, I\u2019d rather  indulge on a cheese plate than a sweet treat after dinner, and it would never cross my mind to grab something like a handful of cookies when I want to refuel \u2026..just a handful of  Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos  and I\u2019m good, thankyouverymuch!
p1727
aVIf we\u2019re at home, by the time our dinner dishes land in the sink his head is in the freezer to see if we have ice cream or he has car keys in hand, ready for a fro-yo date\u2026.him and the frozen yogurt, that is.

aVWhile he\u2019s a lover of all sweets, his favorite is definitely ice cream\u2026\u2026with whipped cream\u2026\u2026and caramel sauce\u2026.with maybe an Oreo or two crumbled on top yea, he takes dessert time pretty seriously.
p1729
aVI like to think that this ice cream is the perfect dessert for a couple trying to satisfy both a sweet and a salt tooth.

aVSalted caramel is something I\u2019m actually kind of into and in ice cream form it\u2019s kind of amazing.

VHi All! So, I was at my farmer\u2019s market the other day and bought a palette of blackberries. One or two baskets should\u2019ve been enough, but they were so big, sweet, and fresh that day I couldn\u2019t help myself and against my better judgment I bought an entire palette. After devouring a basket on my drive home, passing some out to eager neighbors (sharing is caring), and freezing a few baskets I decided I didn\u2019t need any old plan for the rest, because I had a JAM PLAN (totally nerdy and kind of obscure \u201cFriends\u201d reference). Really though, I decided to make jam, something I\u2019d been meaning to do all summer and just hadn\u2019t gotten around to do. I was stoked!! But before I tell you all about the jam, can I tell you a little something? Powdered gelatin sort of give me the heeby-jeebies. I prefer sheet gelatin. In my mind, powdered gelatin has a funky smell. Am  alone on this? Also, I find that I always get a better consistency when I use sheet gelatin. Again, totally a preference thing. Powdered gelatin works just fine in this recipe, but if you can get your hands on some sheet gelatin (specialty cake/bake shops have them or you can order them online) use that instead, you won\u2019t regret it! I made a basic blackberry jam which I like a little less sweet, so if you want to add more sugar, little by little, by all means please do. Also, if you want an added kick feel free to drop a stick of cinnamon to the mix or a few whole star anise and let the flavors infuse. So Good! xx Jenny Simple Blackberry Jam Makes 4 to 5 cups

VBoozy.Bacon.Jam. Yep, that\u2019s right\u2026.Boozy.Bacon.Jam. Don\u2019t those words together just get you all excited?! My first experience (or non-experience) with it was last fall when I was visiting my best friend in Seattle. I had heard of this food truck that sold this magical spread called *Bacon Jam* and I knew that while on my visit it was going to be totally necessary to hunt this truck down and buy boxes upon boxes of this stuff. I was curious, excited and intrigued and couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on some. Sadly, when I got there we found out that the truck was indisposed for the weekend at multiple private events. Boo. Luckily there was a specialty market downtown that carried it, so we made our way to the market. When we got there we asked an employee to direct us to the bacon jam. We went to the refrigerator and started loading up\u2026\u2026 until I noticed the expiration date on all of the jars. The jams had been expired for 3 months. Gross. Really gross. We told the store, they threw away their stock and we left super bummed. Now almost a year later, I still hadn\u2019t tried bacon jam and I finally decided to just make my own. You can serve this warm or chilled, both are really good! Plus, this recipe might look intimidating because of the number of ingredients, but it\u2019s really super simple! I promise. You can use it as sandwich spread, in quesadillas, stirred into soups, or my personal favorite\u2026\u2026holding an open jar, in front on an open fridge, eating it by the spoonful (no judgments, please). Enjoy! xx Jenny Boozy Bacon Jam Makes 2 cups

VThis amazing potato recipe is inspired by something we always had at my house growing up. We could call them heavenly potatoes because they were just that good. My favorite meal were these Heavenly Mashed Potatoes and honey ham.  I would know, being from Idaho and all. Here is a weird side note. Did you know that Idaho is the Gem State, and there we call tater tots \u201ctater gems?\u201d True story. Oh, its also pronounced poh-tay-toh. Don\u2019t even try and get all fancy and pronounce it poh-ta-toh. Everyone will hate you if you do that, its also really annoying. But for real, these mashed potatoes are really really good, and you should totally make them for Thanksgiving, and then be thankful you now know how to pronounce potato right. YAY! \u2665 Teri Heavenly Potatoes Serves 5 to 7

VTo me, meh stuffing is about as common as hearing the Duggars are having another child. I don\u2019t like it when my bread crumb situations are too soggy, or if the stuffing is too salty, or if there isn\u2019t enough different textures. Souping everything in gravy doesn\u2019t save everything all the time. So this is why I\u2019m a little excited about this recipe. Sausage is always awesome, I don\u2019t think you can ever have too much meat. The awesome thing about this recipe is the crunch the hazelnuts give it. Its also just really pretty. This is legit stuffing. Legit enough for Thanksgiving. Boom. \u2665 Teri Sausage and Sage Stuffing with Dried Cranberries and Toasted Hazelnuts Makes 1 9\u201dx 12\u201d baking dish

VI don\u2019t know what it is about breakfast, but I love it. Well, let me rephrase that. I love breakfast foods. I actually don\u2019t have a very big appetite in the morning, but I love breakfast foods in general and can really eat it anytime of the day. There\u2019s something so comforting about pancakes, waffles, bacon (duh), eggs, pastries, fruit and yogurt, oatmeal (well not really, I hate oatmeal\u2026sorry, I know a lot of you are probably disgusted with me right now and I apologize\u2026but the stuff\u2019s like glue to me\u2026I\u2019ll take warm buttered grits over oatmeal any day). This dish came about because I was craving  both breakfast and pasta one night. I know, totally a lame story, but it\u2019s the truth; plain and simple. It\u2019s a great  comfort food  dish and is really hearty and filling. You could easily swap the bacon out for crumbled breakfast sausage if that\u2019s your preference OR just add both to the pasta, which is my personal preference! You should probably make this dish for someone, because it\u2019s tasty and it\u2019ll make them happy. Okay, that\u2019s all. Enjoy! xx Jenny Breakfast Pasta Serves 4 to 6

VWakey wakey biscuits and gravy! Picture this. Log cabin, fire, trees, fresh air, hot man (or woman, whatever floats your boat), wilderness. You wake up in the morning to the fresh smell of chile biscuits in the oven. \u201cWhoa, awesome\u201d you think. Yea, because it is awesome. Your hypothetical perfect man has made you biscuits and gravy in the wilderness. You only hope that the meal you are about to eat lives up to the high expectations you have for the person making them for you. Well guess what? These Green Chile and Cheddar Biscuits with Country Gravy do. If there are any dudes reading this blog post (which ok, to be real, I know mostly women read this), this is totally the secret \u201chi we woke up together this morning and it might be awkward but I like you so I don\u2019t want it to be\u201d secret meal plan.

VHi All! The very first time I had REAL tomato-basil soup for the first time at  The Noodle Cafe when I was about 12 or 13. This little gem is in a small suburb of Chicago (where I grew up) and to this day it\u2019s still one of my all time favorite restaurants. There are a few reasons for this: 1) The food is amazing. I can rarely say I\u2019ve never had a bad meal when I\u2019m taking about restaurants, but this is one of the very few I can say that about. 2) All of there food is made from scratch\u2026including their pasta (duh) 3) The restaurant itself is teeny tiny\u2026teeny tiny in the best way possible, with only a handful of tables. It\u2019s always so intimate and cozy in there; perfect for a date night. 4) They have some of the most personal, friendly staff you could ask for, with amazing service. Anyways, this place is known for a few things, there pastas, their caesar pasta salad (yea you\u2019re reading that correctly) and last but not least\u2026.their creamy.tomato.basil.soup. This soup is like punch yourself in the face good.  I don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s SOMETHING about this soup that sets it apart from every other tomato-basil soup. Now that the weather has  started to cool down here in LA it\u2019s finally getting to be appropriate soup weather which gets me so excited not only for this soup, but to be able to start wearing chilly weather clothes again\u2026.scarves, boots, cute jackets, yay! Okay, back to soup\u2026 I\u2019ve made this dozens of times and think I finally got it close enough to The Noodle\u2019s version. I hope you all enjoy this Creamy Roasted Tomato & Basil Soup as much as I do\u2026I mean who doesn\u2019t love tomato soup, right?! xx Jenny Creamy Roasted Tomato & Basil Soup Makes 7 cups

VHello! Everyone have a great Thanksgiving?! Every year I spend thanksgiving in Chicago (my hometown). I don\u2019t get to make it home often, but Thanksgiving is a time I NEVER miss\u2026why? Because my parents host Thanksgiving every yr and it\u2019s just awesome\u2026plain and simple awesome. I\u2019m really close to my family and spending time with them is something I cherish more than anything. This yr was extra special because everyone was in town. My sister and her husband flew in from D.C, Jordan (my bf), Dexter (our little baby pooch) and I all came in from LA and we got to spend some much needed catch up time with some of my aunts, uncles and cousins and their new wives. Not to mention, its been nothing but an eating, drinking and bonding fest (with some golf playing here and there) ALL WEEK LONG! Oh and since we\u2019re Korean my parents like to have all the traditional turkey day fixin\u2019s , but they also always make sure to have a large spread of Korean food as well\u2026so on top of turkey, ham, stuffing, potatoes, veg etc we have dumpling soup, all the Korean side dishes and massive sushi platters\u2026it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve totally been in my happy place this week\u2026.oh did I mention that my parents have two dogs of their own?\u2026and that some of our relatives and family friends who have dogs have been bringing them over too?\u2026yea, so we\u2019ve had a minimum of three dogs constantly running around and its been pure chaotic BLISS! Anyway, everyone always asks me in a very assuming way, \u201cOh so you pretty much make thanksgiving dinner every year, right?\u201d They\u2019re surprised to learn that no, I most certainly do not. I mean yes, I help out. I\u2019ve made the turkey before (Alton Brown\u2019s recipe is THE BEST), I always seem to do the potatoes etc, but here\u2019s the thing\u2026.I write recipes and cook for a living and sometimes a girl just wants to take a break. Well that and the fact that I will never be able to get enough of my mom\u2019s home cooking. EVER.  One thing I make sure to do every single yr, every Friday afternoon after t-giving is make this\u2026Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches, my second favorite sandwich after the banh mi. Yep, I know thanksgiving turkey sandwiches are great, but nothing new\u2026BUT have you ever had one with a MOIST MAKER?! Yes, this is a nerdy \u201cFriends\u201d thing. The first time I learn about Monica Gellar\u2019s moist maker, I thought it was pure genius. Placing a slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle? OMG! Other than the fact that I hate the word \u201cmoist\u201d everything about this sandwich is real legit\u2026.like really. It\u2019s also one of the best ways to use your leftovers. Just don\u2019t bring it to work and leave it in the office fridge or  THIS  might happen to you\u2026and that would be sad. Okay enough of my rambling, sorry all, I know I ramble\u2026but can\u2019t help it!  I do hope everyone had an amazing Thanksgiving full of love, laughter, great eats and plenty of booze!  Cheers! xx Jenny Thanksgiving Turkey Sandwich\u2026.with a MOIST MAKER Makes 1

VSo I\u2019ve had a really busy couple of weeks, well more like a really busy couple of months\u2026and you know what? I\u2019m tired. Really tired. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong I couldn\u2019t be happier to be busy with work, but UGHHH$%$#%$#%#$%#$%$#^%^$%^$%$%$#!! Okay I\u2019m done. Thanks for putting up with my mini meltdown, I really needed an overly dramatic moment. Whew, I feel a little better. Anyways, anyone else ever have those breakdown moments where you kick, yell and scream to yourself about wanting a break from life? If you have, guess what? I have something that won\u2019t change or fix a thing, BUT it\u2019ll make you feel better for about 30 minutes or so until it\u2019s all gone\u2026that\u2019s something, right? This is the perfect recipe for that 30 minute cure. It\u2019s one of my favorite Korean dishes! Savory, short-ribby goodness, swimming in a sweet, soy broth with hearty root vegetables. I\u2019ve changed my mama\u2019s recipes just a tad. I added shiitake mushrooms, which many versions have. This recipe is also often made with water chestnuts, but I\u2019m not a big fan. Again, this recipe won\u2019t change your life, but it will make you pretty happy for a little while. Enjoy! xx Jenny Galbi Jim Serves 5 to 7

VHi all! We decided to make a Korean style dish called Bo Ssam where the pork is usually steamed, thinly sliced and served alongside a number of sides and condiments. We thought it would be fun to add more flavor to the pork itself by brining and roasting the pork shoulder and glazing it with the sweet and deeply flavorful syrup. Not only is this a fairly easy dish to make, despite the seemingly intimidating number of ingredients and components, it\u2019s a great dish to serve for a get together with a naturally beautiful presentation. We took our photos and excitedly started eating our finished product. Bo Ssam is something that\u2019s actually surprisingly light and refreshing despite the use of roasted pork. There are so many different layers of flavor in this dish from the sweet and salty pork, to the umami-ness of the perilla leaves. The syrup really added a great touch of sweetness, against the salty brine, as well a a nice caramelized crust to the pork. We were pretty much eating that pork for days, with everything, and it was awesome. This dish is also super fun because of all the other added elements you can choose to pair with your pork. Most dishes that come to mind when we think of pork are rather heavy. This is actually lighter, and more refreshing. So go get all your cute small dishes out and make this! Bo Ssam Serves 7 to 10

VWhen I was in college (Art Center REPRESENT!) I lived in South Pasadena. I was, and still am a huge breakfast person. In fact I prefer to eat a huge breakfast, and a smaller dinner. It makes more sense to me, and I also constantly wake up super hungry. I also think I was partial to breakfast back then because we spent ridiculously long hours in the photo lab inhaling chemicals (that I think when I am old will give me some weird issue, like my toenails turning silver or something). We would come out of the lab and go straight to sleep. Its those long hour of such intense concentration we would all forget to eat. So getting up to start another day working, breakfast was the one part of my day where I could actually decompress, think about future projects, or less important things like what kind of shellac I could buy to keep my nail polish from chipping so quick. I pretty much always went to  Mike and Anne\u2019s  in South Pasadena. If you\u2019re lucky enough to go there on a Saturday or Sunday you can get their Red Flannel Hash. It is seriously one of the best potato dish I have ever had. The beets dye all the potatoes an awesome red color, and also disguises the most awesome ingredient, bacon. I am so glad we are sharing our take on this recipe with you. You should all do yourself a favor, and when the craziness of the holidays settle down, make this and sit and think about stupid things. Its my favorite think to do. Red Flannel Hash Serves 5 to 7

VHi All! So we\u2019re ending this week with a little something called the 50/50 burger. I had this burger for the first time at this place called  Slater\u2019s 50/50: Burgers by Design . It\u2019s a burger place that acts sort of like a pub/sports bar. They have a great selection of burgers and beers to accompany them. Anyway, this burger is awesome. When I make this I like to use applewood smoked bacon with a hint of sweet maple. The type of bacon you use is important because it\u2019s what flavors your burgers. I do recommend that you actually grind the bacon and not just chop it up bc it\u2019ll mix and allow the fat to distribute more evenly which is so important when it comes time to cooking the patties. I also ground my own sirloin, but you certainly don\u2019t have to\u2026.don\u2019t have a meat grinder at home? It\u2019s okay, you can ask your local butcher or go to a specialty market and they\u2019re usually pretty good about doing it for you. If you have no choice, you can throw it in the food processor\u2026but make sure the bacon is partially to almost fully frozen, if not the fat will probably get stuck in the blade and not actually grind up (the bacon should be partially frozen when using any method including a meat grinder and mincing with a knife). I love things like burgers because you can make them however you want and dress it exactly how you like it. I highly recommend you all go make this burger this weekend (and have it with a few cold beers, of course) it\u2019s simple, easy and burgers are awesome\u2026especially this one! :) xx Jenny Double 50/50 Burger Serves 3

VWhen I make this I like to use applewood smoked bacon with a hint of sweet maple.
p2798
aVThe type of bacon you use is important because it\u2019s what flavors your burgers.
p2799
aVI do recommend that you actually grind the bacon and not just chop it up bc it\u2019ll mix and allow the fat to distribute more evenly which is so important when it comes time to cooking the patties.
p2800
aVI also ground my own sirloin, but you certainly don\u2019t have to\u2026.don\u2019t have a meat grinder at home?
p2801
aVIf you have no choice, you can throw it in the food processor\u2026but make sure the bacon is partially to almost fully frozen, if not the fat will probably get stuck in the blade and not actually grind up (the bacon should be partially frozen when using any method including a meat grinder and mincing with a knife).

VHi All! Hope everyone had a great time at their prospective super bowl parties. Who won? Who was playing again?! Just kidding\u2026sorta. Anyway, now that we\u2019re all rolling ourselves to work this morning, from eating our lives away why not keep going with that just a little longer and indulge in these little guys. Cream Puff Doughnuts! Yea, I know\u2026.AAAWWWESOME! Back in December we posted a recipe for  No Yeast Cake doughnuts.  The recipe is super simple especially since I decided to go the \u201d no yeast\u201d route which totally simplifies the recipe and cuts down on the prep time. I think doughnuts are like a gift from the Gods\u2026who first decided to start frying sweet dough, dowse it in sugar and eat it? Whoever that person was, I\u2019d like to give them a hug; what a genius. Doughnuts are a sweet treat that I can definitely get on board with all day, everyday. Why split them open and shove pastry cream in them? Cause it\u2019s awesome and cute\u2026.really cute! If you want the recipe for our No Yeast Cake Doughnuts don\u2019t forget to hop over  here  to get the full recipe. I\u2019ve provided the recipe for a basic vanilla pastry cream below.

aV1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup milk, egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, and cornstarch. Set aside.\u000a
p3054
aV2. In a medium saucepan add remaining milk, cream and sugar. Bring the mixture to a light simmer.\u000a

aV5. Once the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stir in the vanilla and butter and whisk until fully incorporated.\u000a
p3058
aV6. Strain mixture into a bowl sitting over an ice bath and allow to cool completely.\u000a
p3059
aV7. Cover the cooled pastry cream and place it in the refrigerator for at least an hour or until ready to use.\u000a

aV**To assemble: Slice doughnuts in half, pipe a small amount of pastry cream on the bottom half of the doughnuts and sandwich the tops back on. Finish with a light dusting of powdered sugar. Serve\u000a
p3061
aV**Tip: If your pastry cream is not as stiff as you would like it you can fold in a 1 1/2 of whipped cream to the mixture to lighten the mixture and allow it to hold its shape.\u000a

VHey! Did everyone have a good weekend? Even though I was super busy I actually had a pretty nice little weekend. One of my favorite parts was brunching with the boyfriend at  Gum Tree ; a great Aussie inspired cafe in the South Bay. We sat outside because the weather was great, the food was great, and the people watched was great. I LOVE people watching. It\u2019s such a great way to relax and sort of get lost in thought. Sometimes we\u2019ll make up random and funny stories about the people passing by, just to entertain ourselves. Nerdy, yes. Entertaining, absolutely. Anyway, Tuesday is Valentine\u2019s Day and this is the perfect shake to make a loved one or even just for yourself as a decadent sweet treat. Not only is this milkshake awesome because it\u2019s pretty and pink, but also because it has actual poundcake in it. Oh, and the roasted strawberries\u2026totally awesome and delicious. Roasting them adds depth to this fun dessert. So regardless of what you do this Valentine\u2019s Day, make sure to include this tasty  and super simple shake into a part of your day! Seriously. Enjoy, all! xx Jenny Roasted Strawberry Shortcake Shakes Makes 2

VHi All! So today we have some pretty chicken lettuce wraps for you. We\u2019re trying to keep things a little lighter this week (okay, so chicken lettuce wraps might not be the most healthy thing, but since its wrapped in cups of lettuce, it\u2019s pretty much considered healthy to me). Anyway, back to trying to be healthy\u2026we\u2019re doing this for one reason\u2026because next week we\u2019re jumping into a deep fry fest of sorts to prep for the big game\u2026and lets be serious, game day is ALL about the food and booze! Again, these lettuce cups are great. Don\u2019t let the long list of ingredients intimidate you. This dish is actually very easy and doesn\u2019t take much time to throw together. We opted for butter lettuce, bc maybe there was an incident of me forcing Teri to help me in the kitchen by breaking apart a head of iceberg to make lettuce cups and maybe instead we ended up with a chopped salad of iceberg instead of the cups..\u2026just maybe :) You take your pick, both totally work great for this dish. Enjoy! xx Jenny Chicken Lettuce Wraps Serves 4 to 6

V Dessert Pizza. I get it, it may seem strange to some people. It is, its a weird idea, but I think its a glorious one. The closest thing I can think of is Pizza Huts (or maybe Dominos?) has these cinnamon sugar bread sticks. Now, while I dislike having to compare this recipe to those pizza places, I am doing so in an attempt to get you into your comfort zone. This is bomb. Blueberries, cinnamon sugar, cream cheese, mozzarella, it is actually really good. So I hope you will look upon these images, and this recipe and think it would be a good idea to make this. I am going to ask for it as my birthday cake. \u2665 Teri Blueberry Dessert Pizza Makes 1

VHi All! So it\u2019s starting to get really warm in LA, which makes me think of a few things: how I still haven\u2019t lost all of my \u201choliday weight\u201d (whoops), wishing my apartment had central air (\u201can ocean breeze\u201d just isn\u2019t the same) and last but not least\u2026.brunch! Not that brunch isn\u2019t awesome all year long, because it totally is, but I love warm weather brunch in particular\u2026that\u2019s all :) One of my favorite brunch dishes, that isn\u2019t necessary something you see everywhere or all the time, is chilaquiles. If you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s pretty much really tasty, soggy, baked chips\u2026yep, awesome. This is a super easy and basic version of a dish that has hundreds of variations. You can seriously add anything to it, corn, black beans, diced avocados, carne asada, diced chayote, ANYTHING! The key is really coating the chips in liquid and having a good balance between liquid and chip\u2026.you don\u2019t want the chips swimming in liquid even after they\u2019re out of the oven, but you also don\u2019t want to bite into a pile of dry, \u201cstale-like\u201d chips. It\u2019s a great dish to make for a group of people. This recipe makes a lot and it\u2019s pretty filling. Everyone should definitely make this dish for brunch this weekend; total crowd pleaser. Enjoy! xx Jenny Super Simple Chilaquiles Makes 1 12\u201d skillet

VIf you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s pretty much really tasty, soggy, baked chips\u2026yep, awesome.
p3361
aVThe key is really coating the chips in liquid and having a good balance between liquid and chip\u2026.you don\u2019t want the chips swimming in liquid even after they\u2019re out of the oven, but you also don\u2019t want to bite into a pile of dry, \u201cstale-like\u201d chips.

aVNot that brunch isn\u2019t awesome all year long, because it totally is, but I love warm weather brunch in particular\u2026that\u2019s all :) One of my favorite brunch dishes, that isn\u2019t necessary something you see everywhere or all the time, is chilaquiles.

VStrawberries and Cream. I grew up in Idaho, where my grandparents had a miniature farm on the outskirts of Boise. They had a little strawberry patch that I used to pick from. As a child, I remember being fascinated by the little berries growing from the plants. They were so tiny and cute, nothing like the large ones you find at the market. They were charming. My favorite way to eat them was chopped all up, sprinkled with sugar, and covered in a fatty milk. Strawberries and cream will always be one of the most delicious and simple things you can ever eat. Today, we have a take on my fond childhood memories.  A simple graham cracker crust, filled with sweet strawberries, and topped with a fluffy meringue, Strawberries & Cream. Yum. \u2665 Teri Strawberries & Cream Serves 6 to 8

p3426
aV5. For the meringue: Place egg whites into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or a hand mixer) and beat on medium speed until mixture begins to get frothy, 1 minute. Add cream of tartar and bring speed up to medium-high, beat for about 2 minutes. With the motor running, begin adding sugar until fully incorporated and mixture is glossy and forms stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold in vanilla and scoop mixture into a piping bag, with a round tip .\u000a
p3427
aV6. To assemble: Pour strawberries (juices and all) over crust and spread  to form an even layer. Pipe meringue over strawberries and place dish under a broiler for 1 to 2 minute or use a brulee torch to gently brulee the top (don\u2019t singe it like I did, above!). Serve.\u000a

VHi All! It\u2019s Friday\u2026yay! Well not really bc i\u2019m working tomorrow, BUT I\u2019m heading up to Carmel on Sunday for a few days with the bf and the pooch and I\u2019m so excited! We\u2019re staying at a bed n\u2019 breakfast that serves fresh cookies everyday (the part my bf is most excited about), which is super cute. We\u2019re driving and not flying this time to take advantage of the scenic/ocean view route up PCH, which I\u2019m only half excited about. Im sure the view will be great, but to me \u201croad trips\u201d usually mean lots of bathroom stops, unavoidable antsiness and constantly feeling like it\u2019s stuffy. There is a definite upside to this long drive though\u2026I\u2019m making kimbap for the ride! Kimbap is basically korean-style sushi rolls with really no fish involved. It\u2019s pretty much a marinated beef, veg and rice roll with many many variations. This is just my favorite kind to make. I love love love kimbap\u2026it\u2019s a great Korean snack that can really be eaten as a meal because it\u2019s so filling. If you don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of marinating meats and seasoning spinach etc just head to your local Korean market bc they usually have that stuff pre-marinated/seasoned for you, making this already easy recipe that much faster to put together! If you\u2019ve never had kimbap, I urge you to make this, it\u2019s really quite a tasty little snack/meal and you can just pop the pieces into your mouth\u2026OR you can be like me dad, not cut it into slices and eat the whole roll like a burrito\u2026yea, my dad\u2019s incredibly awesome like that :) Anyway, I hope everyone has a great weekend! Enjoy! xx Jenny Kimbap Makes 4 rolls

VHey All! So the weather in LA has been kind of funky lately. We keep getting a weird blend of chilly and warm weather.

It\u2019s weird and kind of annoying. Plus, it\u2019s making me get sick\u2026.or was it because I was up in Carmel this weekend, running around the beach in 50 degree weather without a jacket or close toed shoes\u2026hmm\u2026but I digress. Anyway, I came back to chilly LA weather and now I have a stuffy nose, cough, blah blah blah\u2026 This really only means one thing\u2026.time for New England Clam Chowder. Yes! Not to mention, after having plenty of chowder up North the past few days, I\u2019ve realized that I have yet to make even a single batch of one of my all time favorite soups/chowders this year! This is my favorite way to make clam chowder. I cut out the usual celery and added some leeks and corn\u2026only because, well\u2026I love leeks and corn, that\u2019s all :). This is also quite a simple recipe\u2026not very much fuss beyond cutting up some veg! Enjoy! xx Jenny New England Clam Chowder Serves 5 to 7

VHappy Monday! I watched Office Space this weekend. Remember that movie in all of its PC load letter goodness? So good. So so good. I had not seen it in awhile, and this scene, where the lady makes this horrible face and says in a highly annoying voice  \u201cSomebody has a case of the Mondays\u201d  makes me want to punch people in the face. Like really. I want to punch people. She should win awards for her ability to say that phrase so well it makes my skin crawl. Ew. Ew. God I love that movie though. Its a keeper. So I hope you are all not completely down today, it being Monday and all. Look on the bright side, we have this wonderful breakfast recipe for you, and you can go home and snuggle on the couch and watch Office Space after work. You could also go home and make this recipe.  It will make  you feel good. Eggs, delicious gravy, fried steak!!!! YES! OR you can just look forward to making it this weekend all week. Have fun. \u2665 Teri Country Style Eggs Benedict Makes 8

VLets go over a few things I learned recently. 1. If you have an iphone 4S and change Siri\u2019s voice to UK, it sounds like you have Carson from Downton Abbey talking to you, pretty cool (Do you watch Downton Abbey? You really should, its awesome). 2. If you wear new dark denim jeans you have never washed, and them rub your hands on them, then look at your hands, you will think you are dying because your hands are blue. Good thing you\u2019re not, and its just the dye in the pants. Stupid. 3. You can\u2019t buy girl scout cookies online. Honestly, WTF. 4. When you have obese cats, and you put them on a diet, its a life ruiner (they won\u2019t stop complaining!). 5. Fried things in sandwiches is ALWAYS, yes ALWAYS a good idea, and no matter what, will ALWAYS be good. That is where todays recipe comes in. Oyster Po\u2019 Boys SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. I\u2019ve been wanting to eat one of these for a long time. Oysters have been a serious obsession ever since visiting Seattle. I can\u2019t get enough. So having them in sandwich form is pretty spectacular. I hope you will think so too. \u2665 Teri Oyster Po\u2019 Boy Makes 1

I do. This dream is becoming slightly more of a reality because I have pigeons nesting by my bathroom window. Pigeons are really scary. Its really scary to be half awake and putting lotion on in the mirror and look over to see a bird staring at you. It unsettling, to say the least. I wish the pigeons were cute little birds that chirped instead of making that weird loud cat purr noise. But, they are not. I might start wearing ribbons in my hair so I can live part of my dream. I dunno. Also In my get pumped up morning dream, I have milkshakes for breakfast. In my dream milkshakes in the morning is like drinking OJ, good for you.

VHi All! Hope you\u2019re all excited for the weekend! I definitely am. I\u2019m not doing anything in particular, but I\u2019m excited to relax, ride my bike to the beach, take little Dex to the dog park, and to eat out at great places. I love trying new spots and for awhile now I\u2019ve been wanting to try this place  \u201cRockefeller\u201d  which is minutes from my apartment. I\u2019ve been a little skeptical due to mixed yelp reviews (I\u2019m an avid yelper, yes), but the location is great  so one night the boyfriend and I finally tried it out. Okay, the atmosphere of this place was great, the beer selection and flights also great, the food was something to forget\u2026.EXCEPT for their Kimchi Cheesesteak. It was such a random item for this menu, but the kimchi-obsessed part of me was both curious and intrigued. Couldn\u2019t be more happy I made that decision because it was awesome! So simple. So good. Of course I had to go home and make it myself. So I did. I used my kalbi marinade recipe that I\u2019ve used for years for the meat and only topped the meat with kimchi and cheese. In this case, the more basic the better. The kalbi recipe itself is also a simple and basic marinade recipe that\u2019s great to use, not just in this sandwich but it\u2019s also great over rice, wrapped in lettuce leaves, diced and served in tacos, etc. I hope everyone has a great weekend\u2026.making these sandwiches :) Enjoy! xx Jenny Kimchi Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich Makes 2 sandwiches

VBreakfast is my favorite meal. I like to drink iced coffee and watch the cream climb its way down the chunky ice cubes in a dazy before the caffeine hits. I like to order bacon with whatever I\u2019m eating. I like eating potatoes with ketchup. I like eggs over easy, and fluffy scrambled eggs. I pretty much like everything there is to like about breakfast. That is why I am pretty excited about these Baked Egg Boats. They are sooo easy to make. Side note. Remember when Subway got all weird and cut a channel out of the middle of their sandwich bread, and then pulled the bread off cause they were trying to be all different? Yea, that was weird. I\u2019m pretty sure its refered to as the \u201cu\u201d cut with Subway sandwich aficionados. Anyway, if you remember that whole technique they used, apply it to this baked egg situation and I think it will work out pretty well. \u2665 Teri Baked Egg Boats Makes 4

VHello! Something you all probably don\u2019t know about me is that long ago I was a vegetarian\u2026.FOR 3 YEARS! Crazy, right?! It was when I was in high school, after watching a rather inhuman and disturbing video in class. I swore off meat until one day, three years later, I walked into Panera Bread, bought and ate an asiago, roast beef sandwich and that was that :) Still to this very day I love my fair share of meatless dishes. Veggie burgers are always great and I\u2019ve tried them so many ways, with lentils, mushrooms, tofu, tempeh, etc. My favorite type of meatless burger is a good, full flavored black bean burger. We have one here for you all today, studded with corn (because corn is awesome) and loaded with spices. These burgers are great, but still rather soft and delicate and should be handled gently while cooking them. These are great with just about any topping and condiment of your choice, plus they\u2019re super easy to make and really fill you up. Enjoy! xx Jenny Spicy Black Bean Burgers Serves 4

VHi All! Something you guys might not know about me is that I\u2019m a big craft beer lover\u2026.like huge. I live one block from a liquor store that has the, \u201cBiggest Beer Selection in the South Bay\u201d and it\u2019s really awesome because they have large bottles of Dogfish Head, Allagash Black (yes, yes and Allagash White, of course), Pliny the Elder, Delirium Nocturnum, Leinenkugel\u2019s Sunset Wheat, and much much more. It\u2019s totally an adult candy shop\u2026very awesome\u2026makes me happy. Anyway, when I\u2019m not in the mood to spend $12.99 on one bottle of beer (gross) I like to go to one of my \u201ceveryday\u201d favorites, Blue Moon. I love wheat ales in general and especially love the citrus notes in Blue Moons. Plus, I like their seasonal ales\u2026.specifically the Winter Abbey seasonal, but I digress\u2026\u2026Why Blue Moon cupcakes? why not, right?! These little guys are light and fluffy and the orange infused cream cheese frosting is so simple and really good. They\u2019re a fun treat to bring to any get together..so go make them this weekend, okay?! Enjoy! xx Jenny Mini Blue Moon Cupcake Makes 24

VHi All! Miss us much?? Teri and I were finishing up a major project this weekend (more on that\u2026.later!) that left us drained, so we took a teeny tiny hiatus from blogging. Now we\u2019re back and have this awesome wild mushroom farro risotto for you all! I LOVE risotto\u2026the savory, starchy, creaminess\u2026yum! We\u2019ve taken one of everyone\u2019s favorite comfort dishes and turned it healthy\u2026.well healthier at least. We\u2019re using farro today, people! I love farro probably as much as I love risotto. The plump, chewy grains are fun to eat and super filling, me thinks. I used dried wild mushrooms for this because I fancy chanterelles and morels and they\u2019re near impossible for me to find fresh! Feel free to use which ever mushrooms you prefer. Also, you\u2019re all probably thinking\u2026risotto? now? Just as it starts to get really warm outside? Trust me folks, this risotto is very filling, but won\u2019t leave you feeling heavy and sluggish, not at all! Enjoy! xx Jenny Wild Mushroom Farro Risotto Serves 3 to 5

VYou know what one of the worst feelings in the world is? When you leg falls asleep, and then you attempt to move it, and the feeling of all the blood rushes into your leg and it feels like a million baby needles are simultaneously pricking your skin. Its what I imagine the cruciatus curse in Harry Potter to feel like. This happened to me a restaurant recently, and I didn\u2019t realize it has happened until I got up and started walking. Once I started walking I found it rather difficult to move my leg, which then resulted in a most epic slow motion fall. I scraped my knee. It was embarrassing. I\u2019m glad its over. In other situations, we have a glatette situation. I\u2019m pretty sure what makes this galette tops is the fact it has pancetta in it. My favorite thing about pancetta is when it gets baked and becomes super crispy. It\u2019s like the high-class version of bacon bits. I hope you all love it! \u2665 Teri Caramelized Leek Shallot & Pancetta Galette Makes 1

VHi All! Today we have this flour-less amaretti cake for you. I really dig cakes like this for so many reasons; a few of them being: they\u2019re single layered (easy!), no frosting needed (super easy!), and the flour in this particular recipe is replaced with crushed [amaretti] cookies (awesome!). It\u2019s a quick cake to throw together, with only a handful of ingredients; it\u2019s chocolatey, decadent and SUPER  almond-y \u2026.in a good way. It really is quite a tasty little cake that\u2019s great to enjoy alongside a creamy cappuccino, a rich espresso or even an ice cold glass of milk! Mother\u2019s day is just a couple days away, why not surprise mom with this tasty treat?! Enjoy! xx Jenny Flourless Chocolate Amaretti Cake Makes 1 (9 inch) cake

VHi All! Teri is in London on vacation right now! You can see her travel adventures over on our  instagram . We decided to make a dish called Bubble & Squeak with Bangers. Cute name, right? It\u2019s a traditional English dish consisting of leftover winter vegetables (such as roasted potatoes, cabbage, brussels sprouts, carrots, etc) all mashed up, then pan fried like one big savory pancake (sort of)! We\u2019ve made our own version of this cutely named dish and turned them into little mini vegetable cakes. We\u2019re serving ours up with some bangers (duh) and a pretty awesome bourbon-mustard cream sauce.  Enjoy! Bubble and Squeak with Bangers Serves 6 to 8

VDirections:\u000a
p4489
aV1. Preheat oven to 375°F.\u000a
p4490
aV2. For bubble and squeak: Place Brussels sprouts, carrot, parsnip, kohlrabi, turnip, and thyme onto a baking sheet and toss together with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast vegetables for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tender.\u000a
p4491
aV3. Transfer mixture to a food processor and pulse 6 to 8 times (you should have a coarse mealy texture). Place mashed potatoes, goat cheese and pureed vegetables into a mixing bowl and stir together until well mixed. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p4492
aV4. Place remaining oil in a heavy bottom skillet and place over medium-high heat. Form 1/3 cup patties with potato mixture and fry on each side for 2 to 3 minutes, flattening with the back of a spatula.\u000a
p4493
aV5. For bangers: Place sausages in a pot of water and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until cooked through. Pour oil into a heavy bottom skillet and sear sausages on each side, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\u000a
p4494
aV6. For mustard cream sauce: Place butter in a small skillet over medium heat and sauté shallots and garlic for about 3 minutes. Add thyme and continue to sauté for an additional minute. Deglaze pan with bourbon and simmer until almost all liquid has evaporated from pan. Add mustard and stir. Pour cream over mustard mixture and simmer until sauce has reduced by a third. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p4495
aV7. To serve: Place a couple vegetable cakes onto a plate, top with bangers and finish with a drizzle of sauce. Serve hot.\u000a

VI just came back from Paris last week, and I\u2019m still trying to trick myself into thinking I can fit into my pants. Its times like these where yoga pants are really awesome. Basically, you walk around everywhere and there are windows on every block filled with delicious sugar taste explosions, colorful desserts that look more like art than food, and buttery crispy bread. How are people even skinny there? The one thing that I was particularly impressed with was all the crazy things they did with Éclairs. I think Paris\u2019s Éclairs are the equivalent to our obsession with cupcakes. They too come in all different colors, sizes, and decorations. It was insane. A quick trip to a local bookshop revealed this is true. There were books upon books about making the perfect pate a choux, different decoration ideas, and delicious ideas to stuff them with flavored fillings of all kinds. They were so pretty. So today we have a yummy raspberry Éclair recipe for you. I hope that you will try and explore some crazy and different decorations if you make these. \u2665 Teri Raspberry Éclairs Makes 12-15

VDirections:\u000a
p4576
aV1. Preheat oven to 400°F.\u000a
p4577
aV2. Place water, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.\u000a
p4578
aV3. Add flour and stir with a wooden spoon 3 minutes or until a sticky dough forms. Pour dough into a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and beat for 2 minutes to release some steam. Add eggs one at a time, mixing and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.\u000a
p4579
aV4. Scoop dough into a piping bag fitted with a round tip (Ateco #806) and pipe 2 ½-3 inch long strips about 1 inch apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until éclairs have puffed and turned golden brown. Allow éclairs to cool slightly before carefully slicing in half. Place éclairs back onto the baking sheet and allow to dry out in a warm oven for about 15 minutes.\u000a
p4580
aV5. Place all pastry cream ingredients, except raspberry puree, vanilla and whipped cream, into a saucepan and whisk together. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently [to avoid curdling]. Simmer for 5 minutes or until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in raspberry puree and vanilla until fully incorporated.\u000a
p4581
aV6. Strain it through a fine sieve and place over an ice bath until completely cooled, stirring occasionally. [Tip: If the pastry cream is still lumpy after it\u2019s cooled, pass it through a fine sieve again and stir in 2 tablespoons of melted butter. This will remove the cooked yolk bits as well as give the pastry cream a smoother, glossier texture.]\u000a
p4582
aV7. Gently fold whipped cream into the pastry cream until fully incorporated.\u000a
p4583
aV8. Scoop pastry cream into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe pastry cream onto the bottom halves of the éclairs. Dip tops of éclairs in melted chocolate and shake to remove excess and top with quins. Place onto a parchment lined baking sheet and allow chocolate to set. Place tops over the whipped pastry cream and serve.\u000a

VHi there! So something weird happened to me the other day. I experienced one of those awkward middle school/high school, \u201csee someone you kind of know, but not that well or that you think is cute, hallway pass-bys\u201d. You know, the one where you see each other from complete ends of the hall and uncomfortably avoid eye contact until you\u2019re just about to pass one another, then make quick eye contact and nervously wave hello (even though you two are the only ones in the hall and have clearly spotted one another from the start) Only this time it was out by the pier near my apartment, it was an old culinary school acquaintance and after we did the first, \u201cOh hey, funny running into you here. How are you?\u2026\u201d, we did the uncomfy pass by THREE more times! Has this only happened to me?? Am I just that awkward??? hm\u2026\u2026. Moving right along\u2026.. We have a delcious and healthy tofu scramble for you all today! It\u2019s a dish inspired by,  Barney Greengrass a restaurant inside every Barneys New York. The dish they serve doesn\u2019t come with a poached egg\u2026but who doesn\u2019t love a good poached egg, right?!  (minus the sad crack down the top of the egg in the last photo\u2026.boo to me for being a lazy food stylist, eh well) It\u2019s a pretty quick and easy dish to throw together and you can use any of your favorite veggies and herbs\u2026maybe even add some ground turkey, if you\u2019re so inclined! It\u2019s a great, healthy vegetarian option, packed with protein, that you can serve guests at a weekend brunch or just make for yourself as a light, but filling meal. I hope you all make this simple and tasty dish this summer! xx, Jenny Tofu Scramble Serves 4 to 6

p4661
aV5. For the poached eggs: Crack each egg into its own ramekin and set aside. Fill a medium pot with about 4 inches of water; add vinegar and bring to a boil. Using a whisk, create a small whirlpool in the water and carefully add eggs, one at a time, into the center of the whirlpool. (it\u2019s best to do this in batches of 2) Cover and remove from heat. Allow eggs to poach for about 4 to 6 minutes before removing with a slotted spoon. Bring water back to a boil and repeat until all eggs have been poached.\u000a

VHappy Friday! Yay! I am currently making Momofuku Ramen for 8 people to eat tonight. Pretty excited about it. This will be the first time I have had people over for a proper dinner. My friend Adrianna is making some delicious dessert from the Milk Bar cookbook. It\u2019s going to be so fun. It\u2019s so nice to finally have a dining room table so I can actually do these kinds of things. In preparation for eating massive amounts of ramen tonight, I did what most people don\u2019t do, I ate like 5 million burgers last night (when I say 5 million I mean 4 burgers split between three people). I am still so full right now. I only hope that I will be starving tonight so I can re pack my stomach with delicious pork and ramen. When I\u2019m not stuffing my face with meat, I love to eat potatoes. Being an Idaho girl, I feel like I know my way around potatoes pretty well. Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite kinds. This Twice Baked Sweet Potato recipe is so perfect in its presentation. It makes a super tasty and super pretty side dish to nearly anything. If you want to go a little crazy, I think it would go awesome with a veggie burger. I hope you all will eat some good stuff this weekend! \u2665 Teri Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes Makes 8

VHi All! I\u2019m just going to jump right into this recipe today, because I\u2019m super excited about it! Today we have cumin spiced, baked lotus chips. Yum! I love homemade baked chips\u2026.they\u2019re healthier, easy to make and fun to eat.  Lotus chips are a bit unusual, but SO tasty! I love lotus root; I love it thinly sliced and pickled, stir-fried, roasted, blanched and then tossed in a salad\u2026.I just really love the stuff and think it\u2019s a veg. that\u2019s totally underrated. These chips are so easy to make and you can flavor them how ever you like. I like the rich and savory flavors of cumin and curry, but I\u2019m sure an herb combo or even cinnamon-sugar spiced lotus chip would be pretty delicious. You can find these guys at most asian markets and some specialty markets. It\u2019s a great afternoon snack that\u2019s also super pretty, isn\u2019t it?! Anyway, make these\u2026seriously! :) xx Jenny Cumin Spiced, Baked Lotus Chips Serves 4

VI feel old. On my Facebook there have posts about my ten-year high school reunion. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been that long. I\u2019m not going to go because, well, Facebook exists. I probably know more about the people I went to high school now than I did in high school. I get to see ultrasound images, and then pregnant monthly tummy growth pictures, pictures of people having a good times, posts about people when they are having bad times, posts about getting engaged, getting married, getting a divorce. It\u2019s like my own personal Us magazine. It\u2019s actually pretty neat, getting to see what people grew up to do with their lives. Pretty neat. You know what else is neat? Peonies, and the fact that they are in season. Love them. Although, the ones I have been getting smell a little funky. As the weather starts to warm, and people start wearing less clothes (no more scarves L) we like to throw some light-ish delicious lunch situations at you, one of them being this falafel pita sandwich. The tzatziki sauce is delicious, and the pita pockets fit these little falafel dudes perfectly. Eat up. \u2665 Teri Falafel Pita Sandwiches Makes 4

VHi All! So by now I think you\u2019ve all noticed that we get a lot of our food inspiration from all around the world and we have a little thing for international cuisine. I think there\u2019s something so refreshing as well as fascinating about cultural gastronomy with no particular emphasis on \u201cfine foods\u201d. Growing up I was lucky enough to travel to a number of places around the world because my parents loved (and still do love) to travel; neither having been able to do much traveling themselves while growing up, made it a priority to take my sister and I to as many places possible so we could explore the world from an early age [just one of hundreds of reasons I will be forever grateful for my wonderful and inspiring parents]. Another thing about my parents, which I LOVE, is that whenever they\u2019re in a foreign country they\u2019re all about eating where the locals eat. We have travelled great lengths for a good authentic meal\u2026.one in particular was a little trip to Mexico years and years ago. My parents had befriended a cab driver who pretty much became our unofficial food guide that whole trip\u2026it was awesome. On our last night we were all in the mood for super fresh grilled fish, our cabbie assured us he had a great place in mind, but that it was a bit of a drive out of town. As long as it was going to be super fresh and tasty, the Park family was game. 4 hours, 1 mountain drive and 1 flat tire later we fiiinnnaaallllyyyy made it to this tiny shack on the beach. Exhausted, grumpy and hungry we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. The last dish that came out was the grilled fish we were all waiting for. It was moist, flaky, flavorful, and unexpectedly covered in this sort of sweet and smoky barbecue type sauce. That dish alone turned all of our moods around and to this very day we still talk about that amazing fish slathered in that even more amazing sauce. I never had a chance to ask them how they made their sauce, but the first time I tasted banana ketchup was the first time I tasted something that even somewhat reminded me of that memorable meal in Mexico. I made my own version of banana ketchup, using grilled bananas, in attempt to recreate the sauce I once had. I wasn\u2019t exactly successful and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to replicate that very special sauce. What I did end up with though was quite a tasty and unique little ketchup that\u2019s great on a ton of things! We\u2019ve paired ours with some baked yucca fries today\u2026why? No reason really\u2026.I just love yucca, especially in fry form! Don\u2019t be intimidated by the long list of ingredients, because the recipe itself is quite easy! Enjoy! xx Jenny Baked Yucca Fries with Grilled Banana Ketchup Makes 1 quart

p4968
aV2. Peel bananas and break up into chunks and place into a blender. Add onion, garlic, tomato paste, dates, thyme, and water to the blender and blend until smooth, about 3 minutes.\u000a
p4969
aV3. Pour mixture into a large pot and stir in remaining ketchup ingredients. Bring mixture to a boil; lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. (If the mixture gets too thick, add water 2-3 tablespoons at a time)\u000a
p4970
aV4. Strain mixture through a fine sieve and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use. (ketchup will hold for 5 to 6 months)\u000a
p4971
aV5. Preheat oven to 375°F.\u000a
p4972
aV6. Pour yucca fries into a large pot and fill with water. Place over medium- high heat and bring to a boil. Boil fries for about 15 minutes or until just fork tender.\u000a
p4973
aV7. Drain fries and spread onto a baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss together and redistribute fried into a single layer. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until fries are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Lightly season with salt and pepper and serve immediately with banana ketchup.\u000a

VHi All! Today we have Paella for you; our version of a classic family-style dish from Spain! It\u2019s filled with not just chicken and Spanish chorizo, but loads of shellfish too! Best of all, this entire dish is infused with saffron! I like to call this fragrant and perfume-like spice, \u201cculinary gold\u201d. It\u2019s super expensive, but well worth the price and you only need very little each time you use it. Fun fact: Saffron is so expensive because of the way it\u2019s cultivated. All the saffron in the world is HAND PICKED strain by strain\u2026yep, not an easy task. The first time I heard this little fact was years ago and that\u2019s also the same time I stopped complaining about the price \u2026aloud, at least. :) The key to a great paella starts from the backbone of the dish, the soffrito. A soffrito (in Spain) is generally a mixture of onions, garlic and tomatoes that are cooked down and caramelized for hours until you\u2019re left with almost a thick \u201cpaste\u201d. This stuff is SO good and really sets a great base flavor for this dish. I generally make more than I need for the dish and use rest for things like, mixing into my morning eggs, spreading onto a piece of toast\u2026or eating  it by the spoonful right out of the jar, SO GOOD.  This dish is a little time consuming, but really not as intimidating to make as it may seem. Plus it\u2019s always a great crowd pleaser, all the way from the gorgeous presentation to the robust flavors\u2026this dish is a total keeper! We hope you all enjoy this awesome dish!\u2026.jeez, could I possibly use the word \u201cdish\u201d more??? Paella Serves 5 to 6

VHi All! Did everyone have a lovely Independence Day? I certainly did! The boyfriend and I barbecued and swam with friends and it was really great. This was also one of the first times in a very long time I experienced a holiday celebration where food wasn\u2019t one of the primary focuses\u2026whaaa? I know\u2026.there was no crazy pig roast going\u2026.no expensively marbled steaks\u2026..no artisan summer salads\u2026.no punch you in the face flavor packed carne asada\u2026none of that. We DID though have burgers, hot dogs, chips (LOTS of CHIPS), and I\u2019m pretty sure the only veg. in sight was from the  panzanella salad  I brought\u2026.oh well! Burgers and hot dogs are awesome and totally a-ok with me!\u2026.especially when your hot dog magically becomes stuffed with  flammin\u2019 hot cheetos \u2026.HEAVEN IN A BUN. :) Okay, but now back to the blog! Today we have sort of a fun little unexpected salad; a watermelon, feta and crispy pork belly salad! Every summer the \u201cHeirloom Tomato, Watermelon and Feta Salads with Balsamic Vinaigrette\u201d seem to find its way into everyone\u2019s household, mine included. Why? Because it\u2019s so good! Very refreshing and easy to make\u2026.but why not bulk it up a bit with something like super crispy pork belly?! Okay, hear me out\u2026.the flavors go really well together and the pickled watermelon rind (if using) and feta really seem to cut through the richness of the pork. Not to mention, crispy pork belly in anything is just really really awesome, me thinks. This Watermelon Feta & Crispy Pork Belly Salad is really easy to make. It takes a bit of time, but that\u2019s only because the pork needs to be boiled and then sit overnight. Even if you\u2019re impatient I urge you not to skip the overnight wait time\u2026that\u2019s what will help dry out the skin, making it extra crispy when fried. Enjoy! xx Jenny Watermelon Feta & Crispy Pork Belly Salad Serves 3 to 4

aV1. Place water, honey and 1 1/2 tablespoons lavender into a saucepan and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool completely, before straining lavender.\u000a
p5240
aV2. Once strained, stir in 1 tablespoon of lavender, champagne, lemon juice, and liquor (if using); then pour mixture into a 7\u201dx11\u201d (or 8\u201dx8\u201d) baking dish and place in freezer.\u000a
p5241
aV3. After about 1 1/2 to 2 hours remove granita from freezer and gently scrape surface, with a fork, to break apart the formed ice crystals. Place back in the freezer and continue to remove from freezer and scrape every hour for 5 to 6 hours, until you have a baking dish of \u201cshaved\u201d/scraped ice.\u000a
p5242
aV4. For spiced pine nuts: Place nuts, oil, cinnamon, and coriander in a small bowl and toss together. Pour mixture into a small skillet and place over medium- low heat. Gently toast for 3 to 5 minutes, frequently stirring to prevent burning, or until lightly toasted. Pour mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment and spread in a single layer. Set aside and allow spiced nuts to cool completely.\u000a

VHi all! One of my favorite things to do when I head into Chinatown (whether I\u2019m in LA or back in Chicago) is going out for some dim-sum. I love walking into, what seems like a giant conference room, with endless round tables, taking a seat wherever I can manage to squeeze in and watching the women with their carts of steaming goodness jump around from table to table, releasing giant pillows of steam into the air, each time they remove the lid on one of the containers on their cart (whoa, run on sentence much?). Ahhhh, it almost gives me a sense of calm\u2026.in a little bit of a weird and creepy way. ;) I think dim-sum is one of those things that a lot of people find intimidating to make at home\u2026but really it\u2019s one of the easiest, especially if you start with the basics! Today we have a super easy, yet super flavorful shrimp shu mai for you all today. It only takes about 15 minutes to get together and up to 10 minutes to cook. I have added some \u201cdown time\u201d of about an hour in the fridge or freezer, but it\u2019s not completely necessary. I\u2019ve just found that my filling sticks to the wrappers better when allowed to sit and chill. Play around with yours and see what works best for you. You should totally make these little guys to serve as a great appetizer for your next cocktail or dinner party\u2026or just make a big batch of them for a quiet night in and pop them in your mouth like grapes\u2026.big grapes. Enjoy! xx Jenny Shrimp Shu Mai Makes 20 to 24

VHi Guys! Today we have a bit of a treat for you all\u2026well, a totally different kind of treat than the one we had on Tuesday. We have a scallop and uni crudo for you today! I know this isn\u2019t for everyone, BUT for those of you who love this kind of stuff, (like me!) I wanted to show you how easy it is to make at home. It\u2019s always fun to make a \u201cfancy\u201d dish like this at home to impress your guests with, and it really does take no time at all. A couple tips for preparing this dish is to semi-freeze the scallops for about 30 minutes. This will make them much easier to thinly slice. Also, you want to very gently and carefully handle the uni and avoid handling it too much. I usually use a pair of chopsticks to pick them up as they \u201cbruise\u201d (get gross and gunky) easily. The same goes for the tobiko\u2026.handle with care! I went with the light colored tobiko (the one infused with yuzu) because I like the color of it. Feel free to go with the color of your choice. I like tobiko though over other roe, like salmon, bc they\u2019re really small/fine and I like the variety of colors they come in (black-squid ink, light orange-yuzu, green- wasabi). Finally, garnish with ingredients of your choice! I like using radishes and micro amaranth for the slight bitter taste (which is great with the fresh seafood and briny sauce) and the Serrano for heat, obvi. Feel free to go with the flavors and garnishes of your choice!  Give your crudo a light drizzle of olive oil before serving; the quality of oil is important here and sort of brings the whole dish together. In an upscale/fine dining establishment you can probably find this dish running anywhere from 12.95-16.95 (serves 1-2),  while you can probably make this dish at home for about the same price, but serve 5 to 6 people! What a great way to save money AND impress your guests, right?! We\u2019re in the thick of summer and dishes like this will keep you feeling refreshed and satisfied! Enjoy! xx Jenny Scallop and Uni Crudo Serves 2

VHi guys! If you didn\u2019t notice we took ourselves a little break last week from the blog, and now we are back! WITH granola bars for you. Granola bars are one of my favorite things to make. They are so easy, and the flavor options are endless. They make the perfect snack, and they are even more perfect for summer. Its fun to think of bringing granola bars hiking (which I will NOT do until LA turns the heat down), or to a cute picnic (again, turn the heat down). This one is for all you people who go running early in the morning and post it on instagram, and make me feel like a blob because I am viewing that photo 4 hours after you posted it in bed.

VA couple of months ago the nice people at  GE Monogram  invited us to come to Kentucky to check out their  Monogram  kitchen appliances and play around in their test kitchen. We went with a handful of other food bloggers, and stayed in the historic  Brown Hotel . The Brown Hotel is where the sandwich the \u201cHot Brown\u201d was originated in 1926. Check the  wiki  if you don\u2019t believe us. Pretty cool. So in celebration of our trip, we wanted to share this sandwich of awesome with you. *Follow us on instagram!  While we were there we also did a bunch of fun and different things, and what better way than to show you in iphone photos! We visited  Bourbon Barrel Foods . They make \u201cBluegrass Soy Sauce\u201d in Louisville! Crazy! Not only do they make soy sauce, but they\u2019re the only micro soy sauce brewery in the U.S.! Learning about micro soy sauce making was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. It was totally educational and you could see the great deal of passion and intensity the owner has for his work\u2026.very cool! While at the GE Monogram facilities we split up into teams of four and had an Iron Chef competition where potato chips were the secret ingredient\u2026.and guess what?! We won with a rendition of our  Chiliquiles  recipe\u2026lets just say ketchup (yep) was involved to achieve that acidic tomato flavor, a cumin potato chip \u201cessence\u201d may have been made as a topper and perhaps we improvised in a few other \u201cuse what you got\u201d type situations! We learned a lot about  GE Monogram appliances , which are awesome, and you should check them out if you\u2019re in the market; some of those induction stovetops and refrigerators they showed us really made us swoooooon as they are gorgeous and functional! We met so many wonderful people on this trip that made us realize yet again just how kind/generous/thoughtful/hilarious/sweet/inviting food people genuinely are! Thank you to the lovely people at GE Monogram for such an amazing trip to visit your facilities as well as the fascinating tour of Louisville and for making sure we were never without tasty food\u2026.or mint juleps!

VHey All! So Last week I was in Wisconsin on a styling job, which was awesome!\u2026not just because the job itself was a lot of fun and I got to work with some super chill people, but also because going to Milwaukee means, driving down to Chicago after the job is done and spending a week with my parents! So here I am now, sitting in my parents home, relaxing and pretty much stuffing my face with all my mom AND dad\u2019s awesome, delicious, unreal, amazing home cooking (sure I\u2019m bias, but hey they really make some kick ass Korean food!) Yes, there are tons of amazing restaurants in Chicago that I miss dearly, but for some reason all I ever crave and seem to want to eat is my parent\u2019s home cooking. Is that weird? Do any of you feel like this? What are some of your favorite \u201cback at home\u201d meals you all crave? For me, it\u2019s usually my dad\u2019s bbqing (both Korean and non), my mom\u2019s amazing Korean soups and her incredibly mouthwatering \u201cbanchan\u201d (Korean side dishes). YUMMMM! Of course I do my fair share of cooking for my parents as well! They usually request certain things from me, like my loaded seafood gumbo, panzanella salad and potato, pesto gnocchi. When they don\u2019t have special requests I like to go to town and make them something I know they would never make themselves, but would love\u2026..enter Arepa Pizza. Remember last fall we gave you an  arepa recipe \u2026filled with carnitas? Plus a bit of a whiny story about wandering New York exhausted? Well\u2026today we\u2019ve turned that arepa dough recipe into a nice little pizza crust\u2026topped with a lot of totally awesome things. Just like any good recipe\u2026especially pizza one, feel free to change the toppings around according to your taste, duh. :) So I\u2019m off now to go eat more of my parents phenomenal home cooking and hope you all enjoy this Arepa Pizza and have a fab day! xx Jenny Arepa Pizza Makes 1, 10\u201d pizza

VDirections:\u000a
p5597
aV1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat a large cast iron skillet (or nonstick pan) over medium heat.\u000a
p5598
aV2. Make arepa dough according to the recipe. After dough has rested, form into a ball and place between plastic wrap. Using the bottom of a baking dish or large pan, gently and evenly press down on the wrapped ball until you\u2019ve formed somewhat of an 8-10 inch round that\u2019s about 1/8 inch thick.\u000a
p5599
aV3. Carefully peel the top layer of the plastic wrap from the arepa and flip into the hot skillet, then removing the bottom layer of plastic wrap. Cook arepa on each side for about 15 minutes.\u000a
p5600
aV4. While the arepa cooks, pour oil in a medium sauté pan and place over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sauté for 1 minute. Add chipotle and adobe to shallots and stir for an additional minute. Add chicken and fold together until fully incorporated. Finally, add the honey, gently stir together and remove from heat. Set aside.\u000a
p5601
aV5. For the cilantro sauce: Place all ingredients into a food processor pulse 6-8 times or until cilantro is finely minced and incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.\u000a
p5602
aV6. Once the arepa has crisped and slightly browned on each side, remove from heat and spoon cilantro sauce over the surface. Sprinkle half the cheese over the sauce and top with chicken. Sprinkle remaining cheese over chicken and place in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes (you\u2019re just looking to melt the cheese).\u000a
p5603
aV7. Remove arepa from the oven and skillet and top with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and a drizzle of crema. Lightly season with salt and pepper and serve with lime wedges.\u000a

VHey Guys! Yayayaya! It\u2019s finally a little chilly out in LA (again!)\u2026just let me do a quick Giuliana Rancic *happy dance*\u2026yay! I love chilly weather! I know I\u2019ve said this before, but I really do. To get myself even more into this amazing season I like to bake things that remind me of fall when I was a little girl\u2026.enter Apple Thyme Cake with a caramel sauce. :) It\u2019s my fun little play on the caramel apple! Last week I made a  pumpkin mac and cheese with hints of thyme ; now this week thyme is back, but in a dessert! I love thyme, it\u2019s such a versatile little herb packed with tons of flavor. It\u2019s an herb that truly compliments so many different ingredients. The thyme is really subtle in this recipe, but adds a very lovely aromatic touch to the cake. The cake is great by itself, but the caramel sauce just sort of pushes it over the edge. If you fancy a salted caramel, like most of us do, feel free to add 2-3 teaspoons of sea salt to the sauce, before adding the cream. I thought a salted caramel sauce might be a little much for this cake, but to each their own! Oh and before I forget, use whatever apples you like to bake with; I chose to use golden delicious apples because they\u2019re one of my absolute favorites, plus their sweet and tart combo is really great for this cake! Oh and did I mention how easy this cake is? It\u2019s one of those all wet ingredients in one bowl and all dry ingredients in another, combine, mix and pour. I adore simple, but delicious baking recipes and this is definitely one of them! I hope eveyone has a great weekend\u2026.possibly making apple, thyme cake! :) xx, Jenny Apple Thyme Cake Drizzled with Caramel Sauce Makes 1 10\u201d cake

VHi All! So juice cleanse is finally over and today is the first day I can introduce real protein, like fish, back into me diet. Today is a happy day, yay! Okay, so while on the juice cleanse weird things started happening and I\u2019m not sure if this is normal or not: 1) I started getting cold ALL the time. I\u2019m usually the opposite and always feel a little warm, but for some reason I was freezing 24/7. 2) I started having weird food dreams\u2026.not like awesome food dreams where I\u2019m stuffing my face with short ribs and charcuterie and cheese, but  strange ones where I was making jars upon jars of homemade mayo. (I know, creepy) 3) I felt abnormally exhausted\u2026constantly. 4) My sense of smell was either heightened or altered. Did any of this happen to anyone?! #4 on the list specifically happened while shooting this recipe. While it was baking it smelled exactly like McDonald\u2019s apple pies! You know the smell; a mix of fried sweet pies, salty french fries and fryer oil all rolled into one. (I\u2019ve made this in the past, but can\u2019t remember if it smelled like this to me before) Teri agreed, totally McDonald\u2019s apple pies..but then again, she was also on the \u201cjuice\u201d at the time so we could\u2019ve both been going insane, who knows. Anyway, once I\u2019m done with this post-cleanse nonsense I\u2019m going to make a big batch of these, along with this cardamom whipped cream (so good!) and eat it all. I probably won\u2019t feel bad about it either , oh well. :) It\u2019s a really simple recipe that\u2019s great to make for a get together\u2026maybe even as dessert for Easter brunch or dinner, just a though :) Enjoy! xx Jenny Baked Apple Pie Egg Rolls Makes 16

Add vanilla and cardamom and continue to whip until medium to stiff peaks form. Serve with baked apple pie egg rolls.\u000a

aV*Tip: Don\u2019t overstuff these things and make sure the filling is covered by two layers of wrapper. This will help keep the egg rolls from bursting and sticking.\u000a

VHi Guys! How was your weekend? Did anyone watch the new Homeland? My only comment for the most recent show was Carrie, get the eff out of the bushes. Anyways its almost Thanksgiving, which means its almost Christmas. I am the overly enthusiastic person who looks for Christmas decorations in October. I get really excited when I see ornaments at rite aid. I just got a new aluminum Christmas tree on ebay I am really excited about. Yay. The other part of the holidays that I really really love is the baking, to be specific, the pies. I love making pretty pies. I take it fairly seriously, because I want my edible art to be really amazing. One of my favorite things to do with pies is adding meringue. Meringue is really easy to make, and it always makes for a really impressive display because of the height, and the beautiful natural ways it falls, which then gets accented by brulée-ing. Love. This is essentially a sweet potato pie, but more fun. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of pies you all make this year so please instagram them! \u2665 Teri Candied Yam Pie Makes 1 Pie (9\u201d)

p5853
aV1. Preheat oven to 350°F.\u000a
p5854
aV2. In a large bowl mix together the ginger snap crumbs and melted butter until fully incorporated. Press the mixture into a 9\u201d pie dish or tart shell, pressing both evenly on the bottom and up the sides. Place onto a baking sheet and then into the refrigerator until ready to use.\u000a
p5855
aV3. Place sweet potatoes in a bowl and add the remaining filling ingredients. Stir together until fully incorporated and no lumps remain. Pour the filling into the prepared crust and carefully set into the lowest rack of the oven. Bake for 55 to 75 minutes or until the filling has set, but is slightly loose in the middle.\u000a
p5856
aV4. Allow pie to cool completely, about 2 hours.\u000a
p5857
aV5. For the meringue: Place egg whites into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or in a large bowl, if using a hand mixer. Beat eggs on medium- high speed until medium peaks form. With the motor running, begin adding the sugar, ¼ cup at a time until all the sugar has been added. Add the pinch of salt and continue to whip until stiff peaks form.\u000a
p5858

VHey Guys! Thank you so much for all of your awesome support in making our book release such a fun and successful time for us! Thank you, thank you!! The winners of our Tiny Food Giveaway are: Kate with her awesome/unique answer of \u201cMini Crabbies\u201d and our randomly chosen winner Madelana. Congrats you two!! We\u2019ll be emailing you each shortly! Now to food! :) Around this time of year you see one thing pop up EVERYWHERE. Pumpkins. Oh pumpkins, how I love you so\u2026. and also totally jump on the hoarding pumpkin ale, lattes and ice cream wagon. There\u2019s just something so quintessentially \u2018autumn\u2019 about pumpkins and the flavor they embody. Even beyond food, I think it reminds people that scarf and cozy sweater season is creeping its way into homes (yay!) and in some places that the leaves are beginning to get really beautiful. It\u2019s also the time of year where you begin to feel that perfect crisp air in the morning as you step out your door and take in your first deep breath of fresh air. Yup, pumpkins and fall\u2026.swoooon! So in honor of pumpkins, their awesomeness and the nice chilly weather we\u2019re finally getting here in LA, we have pumpkin mac and cheese infused with thyme for you to whip up this weekend! I really enjoy using pumpkin in my baked goods (more of that later this month!), but I LOVE using it in savory dishes. Last year we had our  Pumpkin Risotto with Seared Scallops \u2026so good! This mac and cheese combo may seem a little odd, but the pumpkin is subtle enough with the creaminess of the sauce/cheeses and the thyme sort of brings everything together. This dish is perfect for this time of year and I urge you all to make it this weekend, cozy up with someone special and enjoy! xx, Jenny Pumpkin Thyme Mac and Cheese Serves 4 to 5

VHelloooo! It has been so freaking hot in Los Angeles the past few weeks it makes me angry to think about it. I have been lucky enough to have a break in work where I have some days off in a row. It\u2019s weird though; I don\u2019t know what to do with myself with all this free time. I have primarily been spending it drinking iced coffee in bed and powering through seasons and seasons of the West Wing. That show is good! Another show that I know everyone including myself loves in Breaking Bad. Did you see the second to last episode (I think) where the lawyer brings the bank lady  BACON BANANA COOKIES?!?!  We have a recipe for  that . You should check it out. Anyway, what shows have you all been watching that maybe I am missing? I need better TV in my life. When I am not watching TV, I am thinking about how much I hate this weather, and how much I want it to rain and be cold. I have been pining for scarves, wool coats, socks, and soups. Nothing is better in cold weather than a really bomb bowl of soup. Summer is almost over and I have to say I am so not sad to see it go. To celebrate the end of summer coming, we have Roasted Corn Chowder for you. It\u2019s probably my favorite kind of soup ever in the entire world. \u2665 Teri Roasted Corn Chowder Serves 3 to 4

VHi all! Today we have a really yummy stuffing for you\u2026.and it\u2019s vegetarian friendly! My sister\u2019s a vegetarian (the kinds that still eats fish though, hooray sushi dinners!) and poor her because she\u2019s a part of a very carnivorous family. True story. Anyway, last year we posted a really tasty  Sausage and Sage Stuffing with Dried Cranberries and Hazelnuts . I loved it so much that I used that stuffing last year for my family\u2019s thanksgiving get together (along with my mom\u2019s traditional stuffing she makes every year\u2026.which is so simple, yet so AMAZING). The sausage stuffing has become one of my absolute favorite stuffings! Sadly, my sister could only smell it and even more sad, stuffing\u2019s her favorite thanksgiving dish. So this year I\u2019ve decided not to be an inconsiderate a-hole and make a very vegetarian friendly stuffing that my big sis\u2019 can chow down on as well as the rest of us meat eating Parks! Okay, back to this years\u2019 stuffing. I\u2019ve used a combo of both squaw bread and whole wheat sourdough because I love the almost honey-kissed and mild flavor of the Squaw bread paired with the more hearty sourdough. There are diced persimmons in this stuffing and it pretty much makes this dish super special. I grew up eating persimmons as they are one of my mom\u2019s favorite winter fruit. We had boxes upon boxes of these guys at our home every winter and when they began to over-ripen, to the point where it just begins to feel mooshy and the skin begins to wrinkle, my mom (the genius) would gently arrange them into large ziploc bags and stick them in the freezer. A couple months would go by with no activity involving the frozen persimmons until one day on a warm spring day my mom would take one of the frozen persimmons out of it\u2019s frozen home, peel the skin back like a banana (while holding the shriveled and tough leaves) and hand it to me to eat\u2026.instant\u2026.all natural\u2026.persimmon\u2026.sorbet. Doesn\u2019t this sound like the best thing EVER??? I told you my mom\u2019s a genius. :) Ahhhh, back to stuffing\u2026yet again! Okay, so this Persimmon & Squaw Bread Stuffing may be lacking in meat, but not flavor, whatsoever. Promise! It\u2019s super moist, but not wet and after it\u2019s baked it holds together really well. If you\u2019re nervous about this being a sweet stuffing, don\u2019t be! It\u2019s a really nice savory stuffing with hints of sweetness from the diced persimmons. You all know I\u2019m more of a savory, meat and potatoes type of girl so trust me when I say that this stuffing is hearty, absolutely delicious, full flavored, and you won\u2019t even miss the meat!  If you\u2019re looking to mix things up with your stuffing this year why not try this delicious vegetarian friendly dish! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Persimmon & Squaw Stuffing Serves 8 to 10

VMy new favorite thing is baked oatmeal. I have always been a huge fan of regular oatmeal, but I was always skeptical about baked oatmeal. I didn\u2019t want it to taste like I was eating a cookie for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I made it. The texture was great, and it saves in the refrigerator even better. It will definitely be one of those things I pre bake and heat up when needed. My favorite thing to do is to pour some soy milk over a huge scoop of it. We used cranberries and persimmons, but you can literally put anything in it. This year, I am trying not to eat 10 cheeseburgers every day, so if you are like me and trying to eat a bit more mindful, I urge you to try out this Persimmon & Cranberry Baked Oatmeal. Add the mix-ins you like, and maybe play around with things a bit. I have a batch in the fridge right now I am about to dig into. I hope you guys enjoy it.

VHi All! Did everyone have a lovely thanksgiving? Is everyone as full and hungover as I am? Does everyone have mad leftovers like I do? Is anyone wondering what to do with all of it?? Well if anyone made mashed sweet potatoes last night (or even regular mashed spuds) we have a great use for the leftovers. SWEET.POTATO.SPUDNUTS. For those of you who don\u2019t know what spudnuts are they\u2019re just the lightest, fluffiest doughnuts (made from mashed potatoes) that you\u2019ll ever experience! Can we just take a quick step back and talk about how doughnuts/spudnuts are the best sweet treat ever? I\u2019m a total doughnut whore and I\u2019m okay with admitting it. I usually can\u2019t walk into a doughnut shop without HAVING to try at least 4 or 5 different kinds. I\u2019m not really a sweets person in general, but I will never, ever turn down a doughnut; they\u2019re just too freakin\u2019 good. Yum. Okay, back to today\u2019s recipe. I know we\u2019ve posted a no yeast cake doughnut recipe a couple of times, both  here  and  here , but today we\u2019re going for full on double rise, yeast filled spudnuts! These little guys are actually quite easy to make and the dough is so nice and pliable that it\u2019s easy to handle. The dough can be a little sticky (which is great for these purposes), so just make sure to flour your surfaces and hands well while working the dough. We\u2019ve coated our spudnuts in simple cinnamon-sugar mix, but feel free to glaze them if you prefer. If you\u2019ve never made or eaten spudnuts before, you\u2019re in for quite a treat!

VDirections:\u000a
p6348
aV1. Preheat oil to 350°F.\u000a
p6349
aV2. In a mixing bowl combine sugar and cinnamon until completely combined. Set aside.\u000a
p6350
aV3. In a small bowl combine both milk together and stir to create a luke warm milk. (doing this will prevent you from having to wait for your scalded milk to cool)\u000a
p6351
aV4. In a small bowl, combine the yeast and water and allow to sit for 5 minutes. (to activate the yeast).\u000a
p6352
aV5. Place sugar and shortening into a mixing bowl (or in a stand mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment) and cream together. Add sweet potatoes and continue to cream until fully incorporated.\u000a
p6353
aV6. Add eggs, milk, yeast water, and salt and continue to mix until well combined. Gradually add flour, 1 cup at a time and continue to mix until dough forms.\u000a
p6354
aV7. Dump dough into a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but sticky dough forms, about 5 minutes. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\u000a
p6355
aV8. Punch the dough down and dump onto a lightly floured surface once again. Roll dough into a 1/2 inch thick slab.\u000a
p6356
aV9. Using a 3 inch circle cutter cut spudnuts from the slab and poke a hole in the center of each with your fingers (handle gently to ensure you don\u2019t deform your spudnuts) place onto a baking sheet with lightly greased parchment.\u000a
p6357
aV10. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm area until spudnuts double in size.\u000a
p6358
aV11. Carefully remove spudnuts from parchment and slide into the oil, 2 to 3 at a time. Fry each spudnut for about 3 minutes on each side or until a light orange-golden color.\u000a
p6359
aV12. Drain spudnuts onto paper towels and while still warm, lightly brush each with melted butter on both sides, and toss in cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to three days.\u000a

VI don\u2019t know about you, but my favorite way to eat vegetables is with pork. Sometimes it\u2019s hard (ok, kinda impossible) to choke down straight up vegetables, especially if sitting on the other half of the plate is some meat. That is why I love this recipe. Pork belly AND vegetables together as one awesome side dish. Yum. We can\u2019t take credit for this Asian Style Green Beans with Crispy Pork Belly, because Jenny and I discovered it at this great restaurant in Manhattan Beach called  MB Post.  As we sat and tried to decide what to order we saw this plate of green beans pass us a couple of times. Once we realized there was pork in it, we were sold. You can eat this as a small snack, or make it for dinner and pair it with a simple seared fish. Yum. I hope you guys enjoy it! \u2665 Teri Asian-Style Green Beans with Crispy Pork Belly Serves 4 to 6

VThese past couple of weekends I have been going on some pretty cool hikes. Normally on the weekends, I wake up and  watch TV  and go on  pinterest  and eat good (bad for you) food. Yes, I am one of those lazy people that turn 50 and wonders where her 20 year old body is hiding under layers of fat. Things needed to change. I feel like in the past 2 years my metabolism has changed for the worse, my forehead wrinkles are more prominent, I have dark circles under my eyes, and my once clear face now has pimples (adult acne (can suck it) maybe?). It\u2019s frustrating. I am totally getting old. I have a birthday in a couple months, I don\u2019t even know if I am turning 28, or 29, or 30. I would have to do math to figure it out. After 25 it\u2019s all a blur. So I have been going to the gym, and going on hikes. Basically doing things that make my bottom hurt. I feel like when your butt hurts, you know your workout was a good one. Aside from hiking, eating better is another thing I\u2019ve been doing. It sucks. Salads suck. I\u2019m sorry, but they just do. For me to eat a salad, there has to be something to make it worth it. In this Grapefruit & Mixed Green Salad, it\u2019s the pistachio crusted goat cheese rounds. To be honest, I would probably not eat this salad if there were no goat cheese. To all the people who would eat this salad with no goat cheese, I wish I could be you. \u2665 Teri Grapefruit and Mixed Greens Salad with Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Rounds Serves 4

VHey Guys! So, Valentine\u2019s Day is this week and I\u2019m already kind of over it. I mean enough already with the overtly sentimental jewelry commercials, the red and pink vomited aisles at drugstores and the rush to make dinner reservations at the most expensive and \u201cromantic\u201d restaurant you can think of\u2026.just stop it, please! Valentine\u2019s Day isn\u2019t supposed to be so complicated nor do I think it needs to be so\u2026.pink. It should be a time when couples take a little bit of time out of their busy schedules to tell each other, I like you and you make me happy\u2026AND for singles to re-recognize the fabulousness that is he or she and be happy about it. I don\u2019t think it needs to get any more complicated or cheesy. This year the boyfriend and I are going to cook a nice dinner together and watch movies\u2026.horror movies, that is\u2026why? because that\u2019s what we\u2019re into and that\u2019s what makes us happy! We\u2019re also headed back up to Idyllwild (one of our favorite quick weekend getaway spots!) for the weekend with pooch in tow, for a few days of hiking and (hopefully) snow! We rented a cabin up there back in December and had the best time ever\u2026plus, for a weekender the whole trip wasn\u2019t expensive at all\u2026.hint, hint to anyone in So Cal in need of weekend plans. ;) So this year, maybe don\u2019t stress yourselves out over buying expensive jewelry or going out to a place you can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t really want to go to; instead, just do something that you enjoy doing (whether you want to celebrate with a spouse or just some really great friends), that will make you smile and put you in a great mood\u2026.because why stress over a  commercially manufactured  holiday. Today we have a dessert that I like to think of as one of the most low maintenance, tastiest desserts ever. Simple Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta. Yum. Panna cotta is truly one of my all time favorite desserts (right up there next to doughnuts). Something about the oober soft and slightly sweetened cream, usually paired with a rich sauce/coulis, that I just can\u2019t resist. Not only is this dessert extremely versatile and delectable, but also really hard to screw up! There are no eggs involved, no chemical leavening agents to worry about, just a little gelatin to deal with, and once you\u2019ve bloomed the gelatin, the hard part (that\u2019s really no so hard) is over. I\u2019ve topped mine today with a mango-sage coulis because I wanted something reminiscent of warm weather (because it\u2019s been freeeeezing out!) and because I still wanted something slightly earthy and lemony\u2026.enter sage. If this coulis doesn\u2019t seem like the right one for you, you can also puree some raspberries with a little honey, sugar and lemon juice and you\u2019ve got yourself a simple and tart raspberry topper. If you want a quick and easy topping that will also set nicely atop the panna cotta, then you can just get your favorite store-bought preserve, warm it ever so slightly, place some over your set panna cotta and continue to refrigerate for another couple of hours. If you\u2019re looking for a super quick, low maintenance and delicious dessert to share with loved ones, I suggest you whip up a batch of this panna cotta\u2026so easy, so good! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Simple Panna Cotta with a Mango-Sage Coulis Serves 8

VHi Guys! Today we have somewhat of the \u201cultimate\u201d chili for you all today! I\u2019m calling it the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d chili because there\u2019s really just A LOT going on. Here\u2019s one of the awesome things about this chili, you can really adjust it according to preference. You don\u2019t want to go through the burden of roasting chiles? No problem. Use the chiles without roasting. Or if you just want to scale down on the different types of chili, go for it! Don\u2019t want to use short rib, but chuck instead? Sure! Too many types of beans? Just pick one or two and add more of them. I\u2019ve also added some Mexican chocolate to mine because I\u2019m obsessed with mole poblano and would happily bathe in it all day. A real pool filled with mole, how fabulously disgusting, but I digress. This chili definitely has hints of mole from the chocolate, chiles and spices. If mole\u2019s not your thing, not a problem! Just scale down the amount or leave it out completely. Although I do love the depth of flavor the chocolate brings, your chili will still be delicious, trust. I recommend making this ahead of time, by about one day, and just reheating on the stove. It\u2019s such a yummy chili, but I do really think it\u2019s better the next day once everything has had a chance to sit and marry. Plus, making things ahead of time is so clutch for events like the Super Bowl. Who wants to be stuck in a sweating kitchen during the big  game  food fest?! Hope you guys try this chili out for the super bowl, or pretty much any other time you get a chili craving going on! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Kitchen Sink Chili Serves 10 to 14

VHey Guys! Today we have a Five Cheese Baked Mac & Cheese for you. What a great comfort dish, right? Who doesn\u2019t love a great mac and cheese and who can\u2019t eat this year round? After yesterday\u2019s food/booze fest (some call the Super Bowl) my liver\u2019s a little mad at me and that\u2019s okay, because I kind of feel like this mac and cheese can fix anything\u2026you know, food that can just do that? Bombed a huge meeting? Go eat some mac and cheese\u2026..Failed a test or final?\u2026..go make and eat this dish\u2026\u2026.car problems?\u2026.mac and cheese will make it go away. Okay fine, so maybe mac and cheese won\u2019t create world peace and solve all the problems in the world, but man a big bowl of this stuff will make you very happy\u2026for a short period at least. :) Just a couple things about this big guy, tossing the lemon juice with the cheese isn\u2019t totally necessary, but it\u2019s something I like to do anytime I\u2019m making a cheese sauce. The lemon juice will help eliminate any major stringiness in the overall sauce, and I do hate me a stringy cheese sauce. Also, it\u2019s really important not to let this cheese sauce simmer for to long and thicken. Seriously, once your cheese has melted and your sauce is smooth, take it off the heat and pour it over your pasta. Since it\u2019s going into the oven, your sauce will continue to thicken and you still want the cheese slightly gooey when you dig in\u2026.no one likes a tough block of mac and cheese, especially me. Finally, I wish I could say you can sub out the homemade crouton topping for breadcrumbs (and technically you can), but I won\u2019t. This topping seriously makes this dish! The small pockets of crispy, buttery sourdough mixed with the soft, cheesy, \u201cbacony\u201d mac and cheese creates this lovely combination of balance and perfection! Everyone should go home, make a big batch of this and share it with loved ones\u2026.really, it\u2019s delicious, easy and everyone will love you for it! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Five Cheese Mac & Cheese

VHappy Friday! I\u2019m really excited for the weekend. Why? Because I am babysitting a cute little puppy some of you  may know . I cannot wait to go to the dog park for little dogs, and touch her big ears, and make fun of her cankles. FUN. Weekends are made for this stuff. Weekends are also made for delicious breakfast situations like the one we have to today. I am really excited about it because there are a couple of things that make these Chocolate Chip Bacon & Orange Kissed Pancakes awesome. The first is that we folded in egg whites to make these cakes light and fluffy. They are not rubbery or chewy, but delicate and melt in your mouth-is. We have also added some orange zest. Other than the bacon, this is my favorite part. It is not overwhelming at all, and it does a super nice job of balancing the salty bacon with the sweet chocolate. YUM. What are you guys doing this weekend? \u2665 Teri Chocolate Chip, Bacon and Orange Kissed Pancakes Makes about 10

VDirections:\u000a
p6863
aV1. Preheat a griddle over medium to medium-high heat.\u000a
p6864
aV2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Whisk together and set aside.\u000a
p6865
aV3. In a small mixing bowl combine butter, buttermilk and egg, whisk together and set aside.\u000a
p6866
aV4. Optional Step: Place egg whites in a mixing bowl and using a hand mixer, beat egg whites until frothy. With mixer still running, add sugar and continue to beat until medium peaks form. Set aside.\u000a
p6867
aV5. Stir the flour mixture with the butter mixture until mixed together (don\u2019t overmix). Fold in the bacon, chocolate chips and orange zest. Fold in the whipped egg whites (if using), until just combined.\u000a
p6868
aV6. Grease the griddle with butter or vegetable oil and drop 1/3 cup scoops onto the hot surface. Cook until large bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Place onto a baking sheet and store in a warm oven while cooking remaining pancakes.\u000a
p6869
aV7. Serve hot with butter and maple syrup.\u000a

VI am really excited about it because there are a couple of things that make these Chocolate Chip Bacon & Orange Kissed Pancakes awesome.
p6872
aVThe first is that we folded in egg whites to make these cakes light and fluffy.
p6873
aVWe have also added some orange zest.
p6874
aVOther than the bacon, this is my favorite part.
p6875
aVIt is not overwhelming at all, and it does a super nice job of balancing the salty bacon with the sweet chocolate.

VHey guys! Lets get straight to food today. We have one of my new favorite salads\u2026.one with roasted dates! I love dates, their natural sweetness and how they lends themselves so well to baked goods, their ability to turn almond milk into a delicious milkshake like beverage and just being able to wrap some bacon around them and call it a day. Dates are awesome. Today we\u2019ve roasted them and tossed them into a salad. If you\u2019ve never roasted dates\u2026PLEASE.GO.DO.IT. They become these delicious candy-like things with a crisp exterior and wonderfully chewy interior (I\u2019m a major texture person, you all know this)\u2026.that combined with the thin, crispy prosciutto, pungent bleu cheese and crunchy almonds\u2026whoa, so good! I used California dates in this salad over of the much prized Medjool dates because they are slightly less sweet and don\u2019t caramelize are quickly as Medjools would in the oven. They also have a firmer texture which aids them in the roasting process. You do need to be careful though and make sure to keep an eye on these things in the oven. Thy can burn fairly easily and even if they don\u2019t burn, if you pull them out a little \u201clate\u201d then you\u2019ll end up with rock hard dates instead of delicious crisp and chewy bites! If you want a heartier salad, feel free to use kale\u2026just as delicious! You can also swap the prosciutto out for crispy pancetta or bacon (although I would recommend speck, if anything), but I sort of like the oober, thin and crispy bit of prosciutto throughout the salad, which really helps to highlight the rest of the ingredients, rather than overwhelm them. You can also swap the bleu cheese out for goat cheese or a nice and salty ricotta salata as well as the toasted almonds for Marcona almonds (my favorite). This is a great salad to make for yourself or guests if you\u2019re craving something slightly different and slightly decadent. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Roasted Date Salad Serves 3 to 4

V Hi Guys! Did everyone have a good weekend? My boyfriend and I had a major cleaning fest this weekend. It was one of those things where we woke up one morning and just thought, \u2018This place needs to be spotless\u2019. You know, just one of those weird urges. So we did it. Not only did we clean, but we organized, dejunked, organized, dejunked, and organized. We finished each day with yummy cocktails, great home cooked meals (lots of  grilled vegetables  and  homemade pasta  involved!) and awesomely-bad movies. It was a great little weekend, indeed. :) Anyway, since we worked so hard leaning this weekend we did treat ourselves to a little dessert out. We drove out to  The Olde Ship , a great British Pub in north Orange County. Their food is quite heavy, but delicious. Every meal comes with a side of mash and perfectly steamed peas and carrots, as they should. Okay, here\u2019s the thing\u2026.I usually don\u2019t go there for anything but one thing. Sticky.Toffee.Pudding. Their sticky toffee pudding is like unlike any I\u2019ve ever had. Ever\u2026..Even while in London (sorry!). I don\u2019t know how do describe it\u2026it\u2019s the perfect sweetness to creaminess to light sponginess to richness\u2026.ahhhh brain melt! I often talk about my lack of interest in desserts or sweet treats (with the exception of ANYTHING doughnuts), but I could seriously eat this pudding at any time of the day. Even if it were 100 degrees outside and I had just finished eating a thanksgiving feast\u2026..I would sit in the sun and eat this pudding. So today I\u2019ve made my humble,  it\u2019ll never be as good as theirs, but it\u2019s still pretty tasty  version of sticky toffee pudding. :) A little out of season? Who cares! It\u2019s so good! Even if you think you should or could skip out on the sweet cream, please don\u2019t! Although not a typical custard sauce, this simple sweetened cream, soaks into the cake so perfectly and adds almost a blanket of lightness around the super rich cake and toffee sauce. In need of a dessert to bring to a dinner party or school/work function? Make and bring this pudding\u2026.you\u2019ll be everyone\u2019s favorite person for the rest of the night\u2026for realz. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Sticky Toffee Pudding Makes 1 (9\u201dx12\u201d) pan

VDirections:\u000a
p6991
aV1. Preheat oven to 350°F.\u000a
p6992
aV2. Place dates and 1 1/2 cups water in a small pot and bring to a boil. Boil until half liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\u000a
p6993
aV3. In a mixing bowl combine flour, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt and whisk together. Set Aside.\u000a
p6994
aV4. In another mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. Scrape down sides of the bowl and add egg, one at a time, continue to mix.\u000a
p6995
aV5. Add date and water into butter mixture and mix until just incorporated.\u000a
p6996
aV6. Add dry ingredients into wet ingredients and stir until fully combined.\u000a
p6997
aV7. Pour mixture into a lightly greased baking dish and bake for about an hour or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.\u000a
p6998
aV8. While the cake bakes, make the toffee sauce: Place butter and sugar into a medium saucepan and melt together, about 5 minutes. Stir. Add cream and vanilla and stir together (be careful, mixture will bubble up). Low mixture to medium heat and lightly boil for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\u000a
p6999
aV9. Once the cake has baked, remove from the oven and prick the entire surface with a fork. Pour half the toffee sauce evenly over the top of the cake and place back into the oven for about 5 to 7 minutes.\u000a
p7000
aV10. Sweet cream: Place all the ingredients into a small bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves.\u000a
p7001
aV11. To assemble: Scoop some cake into a shallow bowl and add about 1/4 cup of sweet cream. Top with a drizzle of toffee sauce and serve.\u000a

VToday we have a soup for you that more of you might know about than you think\u2026 Mulligatawny! If some of you are still scratching your head, lets just say it was popularized by  THIS  guy, as one of his most prized soups (best episode ever, right?!). If you\u2019ve never had it before that needs to change! I\u2019ve had mulligatawny a number of times and each time I\u2019ve had it, it\u2019s been totally different. The first time I had it was in London, when I was in high school. A \u201cclassic\u201d version was set in front of me and I got a little sad. It looked like very watered down broth with bits of stewed onions, cabbage and black pepper sprinkled all around. When I tasted it though, the black pepper really stood out and the brothy soup ended up being pretty tasty when sopped up with warm, toasty crumpets. The next time I had it was back in the states. My family and I were trying out a new Indian restaurant that had opened up in our neighborhood. When I ordered the soup I didn\u2019t even realize it was the \u201csame\u201d as what I had gotten in London. This soup was thick, creamy and bright yellow. It was filled with earthy spices like cumin, paprika, cardamom and also had sweet notes to it, which I later found out was from a combination of sautéed apples and raisins. The soup was served with rice and topped with this delicious braised and shredded lamb. So flavorful, and unique! That night I discovered that there are hundred upon hundreds of versions of Mulligatawny, each different and special in its own way. I love that. So today we have our own version of one of my favorite soups! I went with the pureed creamy version because pureed and creamy is delicious and you still get nice texture from the rice, chicken, cilantro, and raisins. Don\u2019t let the laundry list of ingredients intimidate you, this soup is actually very easy to throw together and everything goes into one pot, which is great and makes for an easy clean up! This soup also stores and reheats very well. Great for anytime of the day year round. This is my go to soup when I want something a little different, filling and absolutely delicious! xx, Jenny Mulligatawny Serves 4 to 6

VIt looked like very watered down broth with bits of stewed onions, cabbage and black pepper sprinkled all around.
p7111
aVWhen I tasted it though, the black pepper really stood out and the brothy soup ended up being pretty tasty when sopped up with warm, toasty crumpets.
p7112
aVWhen I ordered the soup I didn\u2019t even realize it was the \u201csame\u201d as what I had gotten in London.
p7113
aVThis soup was thick, creamy and bright yellow.
p7114
aVIt was filled with earthy spices like cumin, paprika, cardamom and also had sweet notes to it, which I later found out was from a combination of sautéed apples and raisins.

VSometimes you just want a huge pile of carbs and delicious meat. Sometimes you don\u2019t want to eat salads and steamed vegetables. Sometimes being bad (on your diet) is good. Sandwiches are one of my biggest vices. Carbs and meat together make a magical couple.

VHi Guys! Today we have quiche pockets for you! Think old school hot pockets, but breakfast-style, tasty, with a fun new shape! (I totally grew up on hot pockets, so I\u2019m really not one to judge) I like to think of this as the most portable way to eat quiche! I know there are the little quiche bites you can make in a mini muffin tin, but these are much more fun and much more conducive to dipping\u2026 oh yea, there\u2019s totally a cheesy dipping sauce for this. I mean why not, right? You\u2019ll all notice in the recipe that it says to create sort of a filling \u201cpaste,\u201d it might sound off, but it\u2019s very important the filling be thick and not runny at all because we\u2019re not \u201ccupping\u201d these into anything. It\u2019s best for the filling be thick so when you\u2019re forming your pockets things are easier to handle and you\u2019re not left with an eggy mess. Don\u2019t worry though because there will still be lots of yummy egg goodness in the pockets once they bake up. I\u2019ve also had a few questions in the past each time I make a cheese sauce of sorts because I always toss my grated cheese into lemon juice. Why do I do this? Because tossing the cheese in a bit of acid will make it so your cheese sauce is nice and smooth and not stringy at all. I do hate a stringy sauce, so this is the perfect way to prevent it. I\u2019m sure most of us will be brunching this Sunday, whether we celebrate Easter or not, and these are the perfect brunch-y like snacks to bring to whatever get together you may be going to. They also freeze and reheat well, so you could make a whole batch of these quiche pockets, freeze half of them and pop them out whenever you want a really eggy, yummy snack! Not into the alsacienne-like filling? Don\u2019t worry! Create whatever filling you want according to your taste, just remember the importance of the thick filling! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Quiche Pockets with a Mornay Sauce Makes 14 to 16

VDirections:\u000a
p7297
aV1. For pie dough: Place flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk together. Add butter and cut into the dry ingredients using your fingers or a pastry knife until a fine mealy texture forms. Add water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing, until the dough just comes together. Form dough into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 30 minutes before using.\u000a
p7298
aV2. For filling: Place ham and onions into a small mixing bowl and toss together. Add eggs and milk and mix together. Fold in cheeses until fully incorporated. (you should have more of a loose paste texture, instead of a runny filling). Season with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to use.\u000a
p7299
aV3. To assemble: Preheat oven to 425°F. Roll chilled dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface. Roll until slightly thinner than 1/8 inch thick . Cut out 4 inch circles, using a circle cutter, and fill the center of each circle with 1-2 tablespoons of filling. Continue until all of the dough and filling have been used. (For egg wash: In a small mixing bowl beat together 1 egg and 2 tablespoon water.) Brush egg wash around the edge of each circle and fold together. Egg wash the sealed seam and starting from one edge push the seam over and squeeze the dough slightly. Use the dough you have squeezed and fold it over the seam again. Continue squeezing and folding until you have crimped the entire seam of the quiche pocket. Place pockets onto a baking sheet, lined with parchment, and pierce the top of each to allow steam to escape, while baking. Place pockets in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Brush the tops with remaining egg wash and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and the filling has set. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.\u000a
p7300
aV4. For mornay sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle flour over surface and whisk together for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the milk and whisk together until no lumps remain and the mixture is thick enough to coast the back of a spoon. Toss cheeses in lemon juice and whisk into the béchamel sauce. Continue to whisk until no lumps remain. Season with salt and pepper and stir. Serve as a dipping sauce for quiche pockets.\u000a

VI am a huge bread pudding fan, both sweet and savory. It is pretty much one of those recipes you cannot screw up. You can add anything you want and it will probably be good. I have experimented more with sweet recipes than savory, but after this recipe, it is clear that more exploration in the savory bread pudding area needs to happen. An unexpected twist with this recipe is the use of our delicious  Sour Cream and Chive Biscuits . Pretty cool. I envision using this recipe with other things like left over dinner rolls, of other types of bread situations you may have on hand. I always think when it comes to bread pudding you should use a softer mushy bread, but the biscuits did great and it was very very yummy. I hope this recipe inspires you all to make some crazy bread pudding concoctions. GO DO IT! \u2665 Teri Savory Bread Pudding Serves 8 to 12

VI guys! So we went a little MIA this past week working on some fun projects, but we\u2019re back with a bunch of fun and exciting things to share with all you lovelies! Today we have a roasted winter root veg. salad. I love salads like this; ones that can be considered a salad AND a side dish. I also love this salad bc you can eat it both warm and cold, so although it\u2019s a \u201cwinter\u201d root veg. salad, you can eat this even when it\u2019s warm out\u2026like LA these days, reaching around 75-80 degrees! \u201cAre you there winter?? It\u2019s me, Jenny\u201d. (<~ sorry, just had to) This dish is super filling, but won\u2019t leave you feeling heavy and gross\u2026my favorite kind of dish! The pine nuts add the much needed crunch and the feta a nice salty flavor. I like to shave the feta onto this salad because I like how it melts in your mouth right away, binding itself with all the other flavors going on. Plus, isn\u2019t the shaved feta just so pretty?! You can easily shave feta by partially freezing it for about 30 minutes, then use a peeler or mandoline to shave it atop the veggies. Simple! It\u2019ll help you avoid a crumbly mess (which actually isn\u2019t all that terrible, is it? :) ) Anyway, I hope you all try out our Winter Root Vegetable Salad and we\u2019ll be back with more fun treats this week! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Winter Root Vegetable Salad Serves 4 to 6

VHey Guys! Today it\u2019s all about roots\u2026and chips. I love root vegetables in all forms. Mashed, roasted, grilled, braised, pureed, fried, glazed. There\u2019s really so much you can do with them. Today we have a triad of root chips! I\u2019ve always had a thing for Terra brand chips and love the root veg. concept of them. So flavorful, so yum. Today we have a combo of purple sweet potatoes, yucca and red beets! I love the sweetness of these veggies together with a good sprinkling of kosher or sea salt. So good! The colors are also super pretty together. The photos above are of the deep fried version, but we\u2019ve also provided you with baking instructions and shallow pan fry directions because we know that everyone likes to deal with homemade chip making differently. :) My preferred methods are the deep and shallow fry because they just really produce better, consistent chips, but the baking works as a good, healthier alternative. One thing to note is that while you want to get the slices pretty thin, you don\u2019t want to go paper thin bc you\u2019ll end up with shriveled burned things with no body\u2026no buéno. Anyway, enjoy! xx, Jenny Root Chips Serves 3 to 4

aV2. Using a mandolin or a sharp knife thinly slice root vegetables, about 1/8-1/16 inch slices.\u000a
p7503
aV3. Line beets in a single layer between sheets of paper towels and top with a baking sheet to draw out any excess moisture.\u000a
p7504
aV4. Take one root vegetable at a time and fry, for about 4 to 5 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned around the edges (stirring the chips around with tongs occasionally so they don\u2019t stick together).\u000a
p7505
aV5. Drain onto paper towels and season with salt. Repeat with remaining root vegetable slices. Allow chips to cool completely before serving.\u000a
p7506
aV**To Bake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Follow steps 2 and 3 from above. Toss vegetable slices with 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and arrange in a single layer onto baking sheets. Bake for about 20 minutes or until the edges begin to dry out. Flip each chip over and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until chips have crisped. Season with salt and allow chips to cool completely before serving.\u000a
p7507
aV**To Pan Fry: Fill a skillet with 2 inches of vegetable, peanut or coconut oil and preheat to 350°F. Follow steps 2 through 5 until all chips have been fried. (it\u2019s important to use this method in small batches to ensure a nice and even fry all around)\u000a

VGuys, I love this recipe. This is one of those recipes we post on the blog and I think about it in the morning first thing because it could be my deserted island meal. First of all, hello corned beef. Hello CHUNKY corned beef. I love the chunks. It\u2019s a little different that what you would see normally, but I prefer it because things get crispier and I like that texture in my hash. I am the girl ordering well done fries at In and Out, and well done hash browns. Anyway, we benedict-ed this hash to make it even more amazing. Who doesn\u2019t like runny egg with delicious meat and potatoes? We made this to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day. We hope you can sneak this recipe in before you start to down green beer and then go on some crazy detox diet to get rid of the green dye in your body. Be careful out there!

(lp7570
VDirections:\u000a
p7571
aV1. For hash: Pour oil into a skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add corned beef and sauté for 2 minutes. Add potatoes and continue to sauté for an additional 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add remaining hash ingredients and cook together for 7 to 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings and set aside.\u000a
p7572
aV2. For hollandaise sauce: Place egg yolks and lemon juice into a stainless steel or heatproof glass bowl and whisk together until the mixture doubles in volume. Place mixture over a pot with simmering water (make sure the water from the pot does not reach the bottom of your bowl) and begin whisking. While whisking, begin to add melted butter, in a slow and steady stream, until fully incorporated and the hollandaise is thick and smooth (the sauce should gradually thicken as you add the butter) Add cayenne and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and cover with plastic wrap, directly over the surface and set aside.\u000a
p7573
aV3. For poached eggs: Crack each egg into its own ramekin and set aside. Fill a medium pot with about 4 inches of water; add vinegar and bring to a boil. Using a whisk, create a small whirlpool in the water and carefully add eggs, one at a time, into the center of the whirlpool. (it\u2019s best to do this in batches of 2) Cover and remove from heat. Allow eggs to poach for about 4 to 6 minutes before removing with a slotted spoon. Bring water back to a boil and repeat until all eggs have been poached.\u000a
p7574
aV4. To assemble: Place an English muffin half onto a plate, cut-side up. Top with a heaping amount of hash followed by a poached egg. Finish with a generous drizzle of hollandaise (if hollandaise has thickened too much while sitting, just stir in chicken stock (1-3 tablespoons) until desired consistency has been reached) and a sprinkle of chives. Serve immediately.\u000a

VHey Guys! Today we have uni risotto\u2026plus I originally had a great story about my trip to Mexico last week and about how I ate really fresh uni, then became super inspired to make a simple uni risotto dish\u2026.but then Instagram threw me for a loop and I haven\u2019t been able to get it off my mind, so here it goes: Kids on Instagram should be a major no no. Or if they\u2019re going to be on instagram, maybe put some sort of regulation on their accounts? (I\u2019m saying like 12-13 yrs old and under) Am I the only one with a strong opinion about this? Do I sound like an old lady?? Here\u2019s why I had this sudden freak out about Kids on Instagram: I was doing my daily \u201cprocrastination by insty\u201d the other day, scrolling from photo to photo and stumbled upon a very rude and crude comment made by someone, about a cake that someone else had posted. I was annoyed right then thinking to myself, \u201cWho does that, seriously? So rude, so stupid.\u201d Anyway, that took me to clicking on the rude commentator\u2019s profile to see why he thought he was so great as to be able to leave nasty comments on another person\u2019s photo. What I saw shocked me\u2026. It was a little, pre-pubecent boy! On top of this, his profile was public, he had posted his phone number on his profile and there were a bunch of \u201cselfies\u201d of him standing in front of the mirror, shirtless\u2026.with really \u201cgrown up\u201d captions!! Whaa??? Okay, so I\u2019m not a mom (except to my precious dog, Dexter) yet, but please, current moms out there (or anyone else out there for that matter), is this normal? okay?? is it safe?? Am I just being crazy about this?? I just feel like there\u2019s something so unsafe and slightly creepy about what looks to be a 9 yr old on instragram posting crude things, topless photos and publicly announcing his home/cell number? I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something that makes me so uncomfy about the whole thing! Maybe I\u2019ve watched too many episode of Law and Order, but man was I creeped out. Thoughts? Anyway, I guess I\u2019ll just go back to noshing on this giant bowl of uni risotto because when I\u2019m feeling weird or creeped out (like right this very second!) a bowl of this rich, creamy and briny risotto or any risotto for that matter (like  here  and  here ) is one of the few things that make me feel safe and a little bit sane. :) xx, Jenny Uni Risotto Serves 3 to 4

VHi Guys! Last week Teri and I flew out to Las Vegas to attend The Best Food Blogs event thrown by Saveur Magazine. It was amazing. They really wined and dined us and took us around to a number of restaurants/venues at the Bellagio (where everything was being hosted). Huge thanks to both Saveur and Bellagio for hosting us last week! Our evening began with sot an Asian inspired theme at two of the restaurants, Sensai and Jasmine. The tasting menu\u2019s were incredible and it takes me to today\u2019s recipe. We have a simple honey-soy braised rib dish that is absolutely mouthwatering and delicious. It\u2019s a pretty self-explanatory recipe with the exception of the boiling the meat might seem strange. My mom has always told me to boil pork ribs (with some ginger) before proceeding on to draw out some of the fat as well as remove some of the off-putting \u201cpork smell\u201d. Please don\u2019t skip this step as it\u2019ll help to not turn the final sauce into one big greasy mess, plus you\u2019ll have a lot less skimming to do. This dish is great for any occasion, but I really like to serve it family style to a close group of friends. This recipe feeds a pretty large group so it\u2019s perfect for casual get togethers. I love to serve it over rice, but quinoa is also a great substitute if you prefer that. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Honey Soy Braised Ribs Serves 5 to 7

VWhen I was a kid, I wasn\u2019t allowed to have sugary cereal. My Dad would say we could have whatever had less than 12 grams of sugar per serving or something like that. So you go into the store, and start looking at the sugar serving, and realize all the good stuff is way above that mark. I was crushed. I remember seeing these commercials for this mini cinnamon roll cereal and as a child, my mind was totally blown. How did they make cinnamon rolls so small? Do people with really tiny hands bake them? Where do they come from? Is this what magic is? Come to find out at the store, this cereal was like only made of sugar. I was so sad. No mini cinnamon rolls for me. This is why I am so excited for this recipe. These are my mini cinnamon rolls from my childhood, only these are made with pie dough. It\u2019s pretty neat actually, because we are just not entering pie season, so you can make these cute little wheels with your left over pie trimmings. We paired our Cinnamon Sugar Pastry Wheels with vanilla frosting and our rhubarb raspberry cardamom jam, but you can dip them in almost anything and it will be delicious. \u2665 Teri Cinnamon Sugar Pastry Wheels Makes 32-36

VHi! I\u2019ve been really into blueberries lately. I have them almost every morning stirred into my Greek yogurt/flaxseed/honey mix or sometimes I\u2019ll puree a little bit and add it into my fresh grapefruit juice as an extra sweet topper. It\u2019s really tasty and along with my 5 gallons of coffee, blueberries help me to stay sane during a busy week. These doughnuts today are inspired by the infamous blueberry doughnuts from \u201cm&m donuts\u201d. It\u2019s one of those places known for there extra special  this  or their really awesome  that \u2026in this case their glazed blueberry doughnuts. The quirky thing about this place is that their target doughnut buyers are younger drunk peeps (or stoners) who want freshly baked, late-night doughnuts. They don\u2019t open until 10pm and they\u2019re closed again by 10am. People go so crazy for m&m\u2019s blueberry doughnuts that every night there\u2019s a 1-2 hour line that begins to form well before opening hours. In addition, people are only allowed to buy one dozen blueberry doughnuts per purchase because they\u2019re in such high demand throughout the night. Being pretty doughnut obsessed I went for it\u2026.in the morning. Sorry, I wasn\u2019t about to wait 2 hours at night for a box of doughnuts that could end up being really overrated. Anyway, I\u2019m super glad I went in the morning. I still had a fresh box of blueberry doughnuts and only waited for 10 minutes while they were finishing them up in the back. The results?? Awesome flavored doughnuts!\u2026.swimming in a pile of grease. :/ The tons of grease soaked into the doughnuts really ruined what could\u2019ve been a killer experience. Naturally I did what I usually do when I try something new, I thought to myself, \u201cHm, how can I make this at home\u2026and how can I make it better?\u201d So today we have a baked version of the doughnuts I tried a couple months ago. Since it was mainly the grease that bummed me out I decided to do a baked version to avoid that issue all together. In addition to baking them I swapped all the butter, shortening, oil out for greek yogurt and applesauce, so we\u2019re totally going healthy-ish with these guys! Also, if you make these you\u2019ll notice the batter is oober thick (that why I recommend piping them)\u2026that\u2019s a good thing, the batter should be nice and thick because you want a dense, cake-doughnut-like result. You can even go 50/50 all purpose to whole wheat flour if you want and you\u2019ll get a doughnut with more of a \u201cbite\u201d but that\u2019s it. Still super good. The glaze on this is also different than what you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a light glaze that will stay sticky and wet, if you want a glaze that will eventually dry onto the doughnut then you can scale back on the blueberries and o.j. and double the powdered sugar. Baking with fruits and veggies are a lot of fun and it\u2019s something I LOVE to do. So, if you\u2019re not interested in these doughnuts, we have a number of fruit/veggie baked good options for you:  Apple Thyme Cake Strawberry Shortbread Cookies Sweet Potato Spudnuts  Sweet Potato and Rosemary Biscuits Strawberry & Rosemary Tarte Tatin Blueberry Yogurt Cookies Cherry Hand Pies Mini Blueberry Galettes,  and  Strawberries and Cream . Enjoy! xx, Jenny Baked Blueberry Doughnuts Makes 20-24

VI always love recipes that utilize the outcast part of an ingredient. When you realize you can make something delicious out of something you thought was useless it\u2019s like discovering a whole new ingredient. I was first experienced this when I discovered carrot top pesto. It was kind of mind blowing for me, and exciting to tell the grocery store cashier not to remove the tops (it\u2019s the little things). That is how I feel about this recipe. I never really thought of using these parts when I buy beets. As you can imagine the stems and leaves are slightly bitter, but don\u2019t let that deter you. It\u2019s really good, and we added citrus and champagne vinegar to balance out the taste. The result is a refreshing dish that is a really perfect side for almost anything.

aV1. For each extract ,sterilize a 16 ounce jar and fill with the cinnamon sticks, vanilla beans or citrus peels.\u000a
p7980
aV2. Pour assigned liquor over each jar and tightly seal. Gently shake each jar and set aside in a dark, cool area.\u000a
p7981

aVOur designs printed on label sheets. \u000a
p7998
aVExtras: Glue gun, scissors and or an exacto\u000a
p7999
aVHere is how you do it:\u000a
p8000
aV1. Decant the extracts into the bottles. I like to do this first so there isn\u2019t any spillage on my freshly printed labels.\u000a
p8001
aV2. Print out the custom labels, and then cut them out. I used scissors for the ovals and an exacto and ruler for the Happy Holidays.\u000a
p8002
aV3. Label all of the bottles.\u000a
p8003
aV4. Cut some hemp twine. You can determine the length by wrapping some twine around the tops of the bottles and deciding how many times you want the twine to go around. After you cut the twine, tie knots at the end of each side and snip off the extra length. Then take your cute tinsle pom poms, squirt some hot glue on one, and then press the knot part of the twine into the hot glue. I used a food skewer to do this, but other long pockey things would work too. Repeat this until you have pom poms at both ends of the twine, and on all the twine you\u2019re going to need.\u000a
p8004
aV5. Take out the craft paper bags. I cut the tops off of them for two reasons. First, I didn\u2019t want the zig zag edge to be visible, and second, I wanted the bag to end at the bottle cap. I cut about an inch to an inch and a half off the bags. Then insert the bottles into the bags and twist the bags around until they fit tight. Fold the corners of the bag at the bottom under.\u000a
p8005
aV6. Take your twine, and wrap it around the neck of the bottle while trying to include the folds of the paper. Once you get down to the right amount of twine left over, tie it off.\u000a
p8006
aV7. Now you have your Happy Holiday printed bands out. Simply center the words on the front of the bottle and press firmly on the label in the middle. Then follow the label around to the back on the bottle pressing firmly one side at a time.\u000a
p8007
aV8. You\u2019re done! Go make people happy and give them this cute stuff you just made!\u000a

VHi Guys! It\u2019s really beginning to feel like summer in LA. I have mixed feelings about this. I love the idea of summer. I love the beach, bbq\u2019s, going to a park to play bocce-ball, shaved ice\u2026.I love all that stuff. Things I\u2019m not such a fan of: the heat, mosquitos, the heat, loads of \u201csummer\u201d kids everywhere (yep, I said it), the heat\u2026.do you see a pattern here? I wish I could have an amazing attitude about it, but man\u2026nothing\u2019s worse than sitting and doing absolutely nothing and sweating profusely\u2026just because of the weather\u2026and then having to peel yourself off a leather couch?\u2026UGH. Can you tell I\u2019m a little stressed about the heat? I would love to have a positive attitude about it, but I\u2019m a\u0336 \u0336b\u0336r\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 scared. I think I was scarred the first year I lived in LA County, in Pasadena. It was so devastatingly hot and the wall a/c unit wasn\u2019t doing the trick, so my boyfriend and I often found ourselves perusing the CVS up the block, for HOURS, just to take advantage of their central air\u2026it was a sad time. In a bit of irony, here\u2019s a stir-fried bitter melon dish for you all today! :) Okay, this one isn\u2019t so bad because although it uses high heat, it cooks up fast. Also, I always try to start the summer off with a healthy food kick (that usually lasts for about 3 days) and this year I\u2019m doing it by cooking up a bunch of different veg. in a number of ways. I had always seen bitter melon at the market, but had never tried it. I assumed it would be bitter (duh, right?), but I didn\u2019t realize just how bitter\u2026.My mistake for taking it home and trying to eat it like a raw cucumber. The second I took a bite it felt as if my cheeks were being sucked into my brain and my mouth immediately dried out. One and a half days later I braved bitter melon again. I decided to stir fry it to remove some of the bitter taste (that was pretty much my only goal at that point). I used a combination of oyster sauce, fish sauce and sugar to draw out the bitter and to impart other flavors to it. Success. The results were a still bitter, but a much more mellow tasting dish that was actually pleasant and developed the texture of a cooked summer squash, soft and juicy. Now I know fish sauce is really scary for some people (I can drink the stuff from the bottle, while the boyfriend gets one whiff and wants to vom then pass out), but thats okay! You can omit the oyster sauce and fish sauce and replace it with a red wine or sherry vinegar. You\u2019ll get the same bitterness cutting effect without the fishy flavor. It\u2019s really nice to have this dish with something slightly fatty like crispy pork belly because they balance each other nicely. If you\u2019re feeling bold or bored\u2026or just trying to avoid the heat outside go peruse your local market and pick up that weird veg. that reminds you of an alien and try it out! It a scary veg. can be turned into something quite lovely! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Stir Fried Bitter Melon  Serves 4 to 6

VHi Guys! Lets talk steaks! I\u2019m not a huge steak eater\u2026well, that\u2019s not entirely true. I do love me a deliciously cooked steak. Medium-rare for me please. I just don\u2019t eat big ol\u2019 steaks that often. I buy them here and there, yet usually slice them up for sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. Every now and then I crave a big chunk of meat and little to nothing else. That\u2019s when I usually go to Whole Foods or my local butcher and buy a couple nicer steaks and grill them up. For the most part I\u2019m a steak purest (is that the right word?). I like nothing on my steak but a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. On occasion I get a hankering for an awesome demi-glace or even a whole grain mustard cream sauce to pour all over my meat, but this last time I wanted something a little more. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s so much amazing produce in season right now, but cherries are where my head went\u2026and you guys, I\u2019m in love. This cherry compote is so good! The first time I made it I ended up only eating a little bit with my steak because I was too busy shoveling it into my mouth straight from the pan. It provided just enough of the sweet-tartness that I was looking for and the pistachios are like I texture paradise. I think I\u2019m most excited about the cherry-port compote as I\u2019ve already decided it\u2019s great on practically everything, both sweet and savory. I\u2019ve topped my pork chops with it\u2026yum, some toast for a mid-afternoon pick me up\u2026.totally hit the spot, and my homemade vanilla bean and brown sugar ice cream\u2026.this combo actually gave me a meltdown it was so good. This Grilled New York Steak with a Cherry Port Compote is perfect for the 4th of July! Even if you cut the steaks out, make this compote and put it on errrrything. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Grilled New York Strip Steaks with Cherry-Port Compote Serves 2

VDirections:\u000a
p8137
aV1. 30 minutes before grilling, remove the steaks from refrigerator and let sit, covered, at room temperature.\u000a
p8138
aV2. Heat grill to high. Brush steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place steaks on the grill and cook until slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip steaks and continue to grill 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare (internal temp. of 135°F), 5 to 6 minutes for medium (140°F) or 8 to 9 minutes for medium-well (150°F). Transfer steaks to a cutting board tent loosely with foil and allow steaks to rest 10 minutes before slicing.\u000a
p8139
aV3. While the steaks rest, make the compote: Pour oil into a skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add cherries and thyme sprigs and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Deglaze the pan with vinegar and continue to cook until all liquid disappears, about 2 minutes. Add port and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until most of the liquid (about 2/3\u2019s) has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and stir in 1/2 the pistachios.\u000a
p8140
aV4. Before serving, top steaks with compote and finish with remaining crushed pistachios. Serve.\u000a

VDo you remember some of your early culinary adventures as a kid? Where you would find something out and then it would forever stick with you and you wondered why you hadn\u2019t thought of doing it before? For me, those kinds of discoveries were any kind of chip in any kind of sandwich, cereal in ice cream, French fries in chocolate milk shakes, and vegetable cream cheese on a blueberry bagel (still eat this ALL THE TIME). As an older child I discovered putting fritos in the bottom of your bowl of chili. Whoa. I still think about it every time I want to make chili. If you don\u2019t have fritos, my second thought is always layering corn bread at the bottom of the bowl. It becomes what I would later term as the \u201cgrape-nuts effect\u201d (basically it soaks up all the good stuff and at the end you\u2019re eating a soggy delicious mess).  I would describe the pay off to be similar to lucky charms milk. Always having been a huge fan of corn bread, I am excited about this recipe for Buttermilk Cornbread and Bacon Lime Chili Butter. So the deal with this Buttermilk Cornbread is that it isn\u2019t too sweet, so you can totally use honey on top if you like that kind of thing. There are corn chunks in it so you still have some nice texture. The butter is on a whole other level. If you prefer to eat your cornbread alone (not at the bottom of your chili bowl), then you MUST make this butter. It\u2019s like a smoky bacon dream spread. In fact, I would recommend doubling this recipe and eating it on toast in the morning. It really is that good. I realize it\u2019s been hot lately. So if you\u2019re not in the mood for cornbread we still got your back. We recently shared our recipe for  Salted Caramel and Candied Bacon Ice cream with Better Homes and Gardens.  You can check out that post here. (We really are bacon obsessed huh? I don\u2019t think it can get old for us.) We hope you all have a very nice Independence Day! \u2665 Teri Buttermilk Cornbread with Bacon, Chili and Lime Butter

VHi guys! Yesterday we shared our recipe for Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce. I really love making my own condiments, it\u2019s always pretty easy and for some reason I end up feeling more accomplished than when I cook a whole meal. Anyway, while I love all kinds of barbecue sauce (I\u2019m totally a sauce person\u2026the more sauce the better for me) I love a nice, sweet and thick barbecue sauce for poultry. I like the flavor it gives and the char you get from the sugar hitting the heat. Anyway, I thought this would be a fun recipe to tackle because I\u2019ve never seen BBQ Turkey Drumsticks being served anywhere other than theme parks and county fairs. Am I right? Has anyone seen these things anywhere else? I don\u2019t really frequent either of the above, but when the boyfriend and I do happen to find ourselves around a BBQ Turkey Drumstick vendor we must have one\u2026.that and buttery corn on the cob. Those two food items are a must. So today we\u2019re using our sweet and tangy barbecue sauce recipe to slather onto lightly brined and slow grilled turkey drumsticks. You can usually find turkey drumsticks year round at markets such as Whole Foods, meat markets/butchers; this includes (pre-cooked) smoked meat that is great if you want to skip the brine and long cook time. You can throw them onto the grill until heated through before brushing with sauce. If you\u2019re looking for a little something different and delicious to grill this summer season, maybe think about adding these bbq turkey drumsticks to your menu. You can even make a meal of it by pairing it with a few of our quick and easy side dishes:  Hawaiian Style Macaroni Salad Warm German Potato Salad , or our  Buttermilk Cornbread . Enjoy! xx, Jenny BBQ Turkey Drumsticks Makes 4

VArtichokes are kind of intimidating if you don\u2019t know how to clean them. So we have made this quick little video for you guys so you can see how easy it is, and then make them all the time! Ok! Now that you know how to properly clean and artichoke you can make this simple Grilled Artichoke recipe. We paired ours with clarified butter (obvious and delicious choice), and garlic aioli. Delicious. Aren\u2019t those gorgeous? I love the whole process of eating artichokes. From popping your piece off the stem, to frivolously dipping it into you aioli. I love the way the meat feels on my teeth as I scape it off. If you\u2019re lucky, you get a piece with a bit of charr to it. I love the subtle hints of the spices we used. It really makes the artichoke sing against the sting of the aioli. Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Grilled Artichokes Makes 4

aV1. Place artichokes into a large pot and add remaining ingredients, except olive oil. Stir and bring mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes or until artichoke hearts, in each half, are fork tender.\u000a
p8382
aV2. Remove artichokes from liquid and brush with oil. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p8383
aV3. Place halves on grill, cut side down, and grill for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue to grill for 2 minutes. Remove from grill and serve with aioli and butter.\u000a
p8384
aV4. For aioli: Place egg, lemon juice and mustard in a blender and pulse until smooth. With the motor running begin adding oil, in tiny, slow drips, waiting for the mixture to emulsify before adding more. Continue until all oil has been use and mixture is thick. Add roasted garlic and pulse until desired consistency has been achieved. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p8385
aV5. For clarified butter: Place butter in a pot and melt over medium-low heat Once fully melted the milk solids should sink. Skim foam off top and ladle clear butter into a serving container. You can also strain mixture through a coffee filter, but should press the mixture through, as you\u2019ll press the solids through, leaving you with cloudy butter.\u000a

VDid you guys have ice cream trucks go down your street when you were a kid?  I still have ice cream trucks go down my street and to be honest, it\u2019s really kind of annoying. Mostly because there must be two or three competing trucks that drive this area, so we have one coming down our street three times a day driving really slowly playing that song. Anyway, we decided to re-create an ice cream truck staple today: Real Fruit Bomb Pops. If you have never made popsicles before I strongly suggest buying some  good molds  and get to it. It\u2019s so easy and fun, and you can use all the awesome berries that are just coming into season. For our Bomb Pops we kept our layers simple, making them one flavor per layer. We have strawberry, blueberry, and lemon. Pro Tip: It\u2019s best to limit the different fruit and ingredients you puree together when making popsicles. My boyfriend likes to make smoothies, and has a knack for making them look like vomit and other things. So I just want you to be aware of that when you get crazy with your Popsicle making. Anyway, we used  this mold  for our popsicles, and I recommend it. It\u2019s a little expensive, but not plastic so totally worth it. What was your favorite Ice Cream truck treats? \u2665 Teri Real Fruit Bomb Pops Makes 16 to 20

VToday we have a great homemade Sweet and Tangy BBQ sauce for you. This sauce is pretty simple to make, and also makes a nice hostess gift. We made some labels for you guys so you can print them and make your jars of sauce look really pretty. We used  9oz weck jars , but  ball jars come in lots of sizes  and any will work! We used  Avery round labels , and  printed them through their website  which is really easy! You can get the design right  here , and I made it square in case that shape floats your boat, but you can also use these for the round labels too. I really love to make labels for stuff. Especially kitchen stuff, so even if you don\u2019t give this BBQ sauce as gifts, you could print out the labels anyway and use them. I always feel like I am a good clean organized person when I label stuff. Ok back to the BBQ sauce. We have a really neat recipe coming up that uses this Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce, so look our for it. Or, you could just eat it with tater tots like I did (Tater tots are so much better than french fries, I wish more restaurants had them). This sauce has bacon in it, because we love bacon and why not? This is a chunkier BBQ sauce, but you can totally adjust the purée to the way you like it. Don\u2019t be intimidated by all the ingredients either, they all just go into the pot and simmer for awhile and then you get this bomb sauce! Hope you guys enjoy!

VHi Guys! Hope everyone had a great weekend! I was working on a big job Friday and Saturday so I pretty much crashed on the couch all day yesterday doing some writing, with 30 Rock on in the background, awaiting Game of Thrones. I\u2019d say all in all, yesterday was a successful lazy day\u2026.equipped with In n Out and gummy bears. Great lil\u2019 day, indeed! Did anyone do any fun cooking? I really didn\u2019t have time, but this weekend I\u2019m making this Cochinita Pibil dish again! It\u2019s pretty much a Yucatan-Style slow roasted pork dish, marinated in achiote and citrus juices and slow roasted in banana leaves. It\u2019s such a tasty dish! It\u2019s actually one of my guy\u2019s favorite things to eat and he gets it at least twice whenever we\u2019re in Mexico. Don\u2019t let the laundry list of ingredients intimidate you! This is a rather easy recipe to make and if you\u2019re feeling less than enthused about the spice mixture, go ahead and play around with your own flavors (the achiote paste or annatto seeds and citrus juice are a must\u2026other than that, do you!) You\u2019re really just letting the meat marinate before throwing it into the oven for hours\u2026easy! This particular pibil you see in the photos above is actually wild boar. I only used this because I was lucky enough to score some fresh wild boar meat from one of the cooks from Bestia, Erik Sun (p.s. if you live in LA and haven\u2019t been yet\u2026it\u2019s a MUST\u2026their pastas and pizzas\u2026I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E.). When people say \u201cfood\u201d people are some of the nicest, most generous people. I totally agree, and here\u2019s why. I actually met Erik through an old friend\u2019s brother. I haven\u2019t spoken to my friend in yrs., just little texts and facebook posts here and there. Her brother actually reached out to me via instagram saying that his friend is heavily into food, like me, and I should meet him. Not in a weird/creepy type of way, but more in a \u201cyou guys could probably pick each other\u2019s food-centric brains for hours\u201d type of way. Long story short, I discovered this guy doesn\u2019t only work in restaurants, but he is also a great wild boar hunter, deep sea fisherman, sea urchin spear fisherman, etc. Whoa. My mind was blown. The most awesome part of Erik\u2019s passion for obtaining the freshest food available; he\u2019s a firm believer in using as much of his \u201ckills\u201d as possible and leaving little to no waste. It\u2019s really not a \u201cjust for sport\u201d thing for him (which I\u2019m really not into\u2026because I think it\u2019s sad). He respects the animals and that\u2019s super important! It was really incredible and inspiring to meet Erik (Pursuit of Food is his instagram account\u2026go check it out!!!) You\u2019re probably wondering why this weird rant came about, because clearly I went on a tangent. The point of this story was that he had an abundance of freshly hunted wild boar a couple months back and was looking to give it away. I told him I wanted it and the next thing I know I\u2019m meeting a generous stranger at the restaurant he works at so he could give me pounds upon pounds of wild boar meat. Pretty awesome, if you ask me! I brought my almost 30 pounds of meat home and started to break it down, ribs and all. The boyfriend and I were pretty much eating wild boar for weeks. (no complaints here) I think if I use wild boar for this dish again I won\u2019t trim the fat as much as I would regular pork. The meat is much more lean and my results were slightly dry. I\u2019ve since made it again with pork with nice, moist shredded results. I love turning dishes like this into tacos, but you totally don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve added instructions for my quick pickled red onions and super simple cilantro crèma. It\u2019s a great dish to make for a crowd. You can set up a taco bar with fixin\u2019 and let people go to town. Taco bars are the best. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Cochinita Pibil Serves 6 to 8

VHi Guys! I\u2019m very excited because today we have our first ice cream of the year\u2026and it\u2019s actually frozen custard! Difference between ice cream and custard? The yolk content in frozen custard is much higher, resulting in a much richer product. Yum. Today we\u2019re starting with Crème Brûlée Frozen Custard, a deliciously velvety and creamy custard with a deep vanilla bean flavor. This frozen custard is so nice and thick  that you\u2019re safe to brûlée the tops for a few seconds without turning everything into a creamy puddle. I absolutely love this dessert, especially since it doesn\u2019t skip out on the best part of crème brûlée, the caramelized sugar shell. Since there are so many yolks used in this custard it\u2019s important to make sure you keep your heat pretty low as you scald your mixture to ensure you don\u2019t scramble your eggs. Although you strain the mixture you\u2019ll be left with a faint taste of cooked egg\u2026.no thank you, not for me. Anyway, we could all use some frozen treats this summer and this one\u2019s pretty awesome, me thinks. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Crème Brûlée Frozen Custard Makes 1 1/2 quarts

V The thing that about picnics is making sure you have chosen the food you\u2019re going to eat correctly. You don\u2019t want stuff that will be gross cold, or be totally soggy, and or be hard to eat. It\u2019s kind of a hard choice. You also have to make sure you bring all the necessary accessories. It sucks so bad if you go and forget to bring napkins. Huge bummer. I am excited because today we have a really good picnic sandwich. It\u2019s a family style Fried Chicken Sandwich. We used Challah bread, which I think works out really well because it\u2019s denser bread, and won\u2019t get all nasty and soggy. I would pair this sandwich with some crispy kettle chips. You get those two and you have an amazing picnic on your hands. \u2665 Teri Fried Chicken Sandwich Serves 4 to 6

VToday we have two super simple recipes for homemade ice cream cones! I love a good waffle and sugar cone, but it\u2019s hardly difficult to make at home. If I\u2019m feeling particularly lazy, I\u2019ll put the freshly baked/pressed discs into cupcake tin holes to make ice cream cone bowls. A few things to know about making your own ice cream cones, for the waffle cone recipe you\u2019ll need a waffle cone maker\u2026if you don\u2019t have one no worries, you can make the sugar cone recipe which is super tasty! For the sugar cones, I\u2019ve created a stovetop version. You can totally bake these if you\u2019re more familiar and comfortable with that method (350°F for 5 to 7 minutes), but I have found that the cones cook more evenly and stiffen better when cooked on stovetop. I\u2019m not going to lie, although the recipe and method is easy, you need a bit of patience to make your own ice cream cones as you need to make them one by one because they harden super fast. The towel you lay the hot discs onto is super important as you\u2019ll burn you hand pretty bad if you don\u2019t use it to help you roll the cones. One last important tidbit of information is that it\u2019s important for the skillet to be cooled each time you add the sticky batter to allow it to spread easily and evenly. Oh! I Lied! There\u2019s one last super important thing about making your own cones, dipping them in chocolate after they cool. This will totally help prevent major drippage once your ice cream begins to melt. If you\u2019re feeling a little adventurous and up for the task I recommend making these homemade ice cream cones. They\u2019re really delicious and you\u2019ll feel completely accomplished after you do! Xx, Jenny Homemade Ice Cream Cones Makes 8 sugar cones & 6 waffle cones

VI feel like most adults eat ice cream the same way, huddled in front of the freezer with your spoon eating out of the carton. I don\u2019t blame you, I do it too. After making dinner and cleaning up the last thing I want to do is dirty another dish. I remember being a kid and being so freaking excited out of my mind to go get ice cream. I think it\u2019s probably safe to say that as we get older, we skip out on desserts a lot more. So I think it\u2019s time to make some crazy banana splits and be really freaking excited about it. I love this recipe because of the grilled bananas. It\u2019s really that simple, just adding some grilled bananas to the situation will enhance it so much. Here is why: Regular freshly peeled bananas are just find and delicious, but firm-ish, unless they ugly and have brown spots. By grilling these they get soft like the ice cream which just makes it that much more pleasurable to eat in my opinion. We added some caramel sauce and nuts just cause. I hope this inspires you all to create some new ice cream situations. You deserve it!  \u2665 Teri Grilled Baby Banana Splits Serves 4

VHi Guys! We\u2019re ending our week with sweet corn ice cream, but don\u2019t worry because we\u2019re not done with frozen treats quite yet. We still have some pretty awesome things on the horizon so stay tuned! Anyway, I had sweet corn ice cream for the first time about 12 years ago in Italy. I was on a Europe trip with my family and my dad and I were pretty much hitting up all the gelato shops we passed\u2026.we called it \u201cgelato hopping\u201d because we\u2019re gluttonous-nerds. While I don\u2019t have a huge sweet tooth, when it comes to gelato in Italy (and doughnuts of course) all bets are off. I probably gained 10 pounds on gelato alone that trip. :) Anyway, I loved that all the shops had such amazing flavors that were so new to me at the time: honey-lavender, caramelized white chocolate, roasted pineapple and coconut cream, etc. My favorite by far was the sweet corn flavor. I love corn, but thought eating it in gelato form would be kind of weird. I was dead wrong. It was one of the most delicious things I ate that entire trip (and we traveled to 12 different countries, so I feel like that\u2019s saying a lot!).  The sweet corn was totally dominating the light vanilla flavor and it was awesome.  One particular shop we went into was stuffing their gelato into sweet rolls so of course we were curious and had to try it out. This immediately became my favorite way to eat gelato/ice cream/custard\u2026sorry cones, you guys are now a close second.  What I love about eating it this way is that the rolls themselves are light and slightly sweet so it\u2019s still mainly about the ice cream. The best part though is that the melty ice cream gets sopped up by the bun creating sort of this semi-soggy and oober delicious ice cream burger\u2026messy but so freakin\u2019 good! As we start to get into the warmest time of the summer I think stocking up on frozen treats is a must. My freezer is currently stocked with homemade ice cream and frozen custard\u2026.well that and Otter Pops, because I mean c\u2019mon, Otter Pops are awesome.  Enjoy! xx, Jenny Sweet Corn Ice Cream Makes 2 quarts

VHi Guys! Today we have cheesecake for you\u2026.but not any kind of cheesecake; one made with goat cheese and Greek yogurt! I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m not the biggest cheesecake fan. I started making cheesecakes when I was younger because it\u2019s my sister\u2019s favorite dessert and she was always requesting it for her birthday. (and if you know my sister, you know she\u2019s just like me, not a sweets person) Anyway, I got really used to making one cracked and deflated cheesecake after another, wondering how places like the Cheesecake Factory got their cheesecakes so tall and perfect every time. Did they use some sort of special springform pan?As far as I was concerned, the springform pan was the most heinous tool in the kitchen. I get it..you can release the sides of the pan from the cake with ease\u2026but what about the bottom? You\u2019re pretty much stuck serving your cheesecake with the bottom of the pan still attached. (this became a bigger issue for me once I became a food stylist\u2026clients don\u2019t normally like to photograph cheesecakes with a big shiny piece of metal stuck to the bottom) Also, if you have one teeny tiny hold in your pain in the ass aluminum wrap contraption you\u2019ve basically signed up for a waterlogged dessert. Anyway, this brings me to today\u2019s recipe and what I believe to be the most valuable piece of info I took away from culinary school. NO SPRINGFORM PAN NEEDED. For realz. Once my instructors helped me to see the light, I went home, threw all my springform pans away and set out to buy cake pans in all sizes. Really, all you need is a good quality cake pan, patience and a xanax (j/k on the last one). The cake board method I\u2019ve explained in the instructions below is perhaps the best way to bake and release a perfect cheesecake. You don\u2019t have to worry about weird, invisible foil tears that will prevent your cheesecake from rising perfectly, crack-free, nor do you have to worry about serving your cheesecake with a disc of pan still attached! A couple things that are important to this process is patience (the cheesecake really needs to be chilled thoroughly before being inverted to ensure you don\u2019t have a big mess on your hands) and fearlessness (you really need to be confident in your flipping and tapping to ensure success!) Worse comes to worse, you make a bit of a mess and you\u2019re still left with delicious cake! One last thing, please don\u2019t over bake this sucker. You really want the center to wobble for a second of two before pulling it from the oven so you know you\u2019ll have a super creamy cheesecake, which is the best! This recipe and especially process might seem a little intimidating, but it\u2019s really not! I promise!\u2026and if you\u2019re totally comfortable around your springform pan like I never was, go for it! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Goat Cheese and Yogurt Cheesecake Makes 1 8\u201d cake

p9072
aV6. Pour filling over crust and smooth top (filling should reach the top of the pan).\u000a
p9073
aV7. Carefully place mixture into a roasting pan and place in the oven. Carefully pour warm/hot water into the side of the roasting pan until the water reaches halfway up the side of the cake pan.\u000a
p9074
aV8. Bake cheesecake for 45 to 55 minutes r until center is still slightly wobbly.\u000a
p9075
aV9. Remove from oven and water bath and allow cheesecake to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Run a knife along the edge of the pan to ensure cheesecake doesn\u2019t stick to sides when removing from pan.\u000a
p9076
aV10.  Allow cheesecake to cool for an hour. Place cheesecake in the refrigerator and allow to chill for at least 6 hours.\u000a
p9077
aV11. Once cheesecake has completely chilled, run a knife along the edge again.\u000a
p9078
aV12. With a platter ready, place a clean cake board over the top of the cheesecake and pan and quickly invert it onto the cake board. Tap the bottom of the pan to ensure nothing is sticking. Remove pan and replace with a platter before quickly, but carefully turning the cheesecake onto the platter and removing the cake board from the surface. (the removal process should take no more than 30 seconds)\u000a

VLets get honest about gazpacho. When I first learned there was such a thing as cold soup I thought that idea was really disgusting. Soup is meant to hot, and filling, and so comforting that you should feel so good about yourself that you forget about all of your insecurities. Then you realize what gazpacho really is. Gazpacho is essentially a smoothie with the addition of tomatoes. That is if you don\u2019t normally put tomatoes in your smoothies, and if you do that\u2019s weird and I would then tell you its gazpacho. So learning that gazpacho is essentially a smoothie I looked at it a whole lot differently. I like smoothies. I bought a really expensive vitamix so I could make smoothies all the time. The thing about gazpacho is that you can add fun stuff like goat cheese and it\u2019s totally ok. Adding goat cheese to a smoothie would again, be really gross. This recipe for Strawberry and Tomato Gazpacho is so light and refreshing. It\u2019s one of those dishes you eat when it\u2019s a million degrees out and you need something other than a snow cone. I wonder if you all have or have had the same feelings about gazpacho as me. Please share! \u2665 Teri Strawberry and Tomato Gazpacho Makes 3 cups

VGazpacho is essentially a smoothie with the addition of tomatoes.
p9147
aVThat is if you don\u2019t normally put tomatoes in your smoothies, and if you do that\u2019s weird and I would then tell you its gazpacho.
p9148
aVThe thing about gazpacho is that you can add fun stuff like goat cheese and it\u2019s totally ok.

V When I was little my Dad used to make these mini peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of Ritz crackers. It was one of my favorite all time snacks. I still am very much into peanut butter and jelly. Now I love crunchy peanut butter and raspberry jelly on grainy wheat bread. So delicious. Being a big peanut butter fan I freaking love this ice cream. So creamy and so salty, this ice cream is the best peanut butter ice cream I have had. Why? Because it\u2019s perfectly balanced. Let me explain. A lot of peanut butter ice creams out there call for too much peanut butter, and then paired with the cream and sugar, it just becomes too much. This ice cream is is definitely peanut \u2013 buttery, but not too much so. If you have ritz on hand, you should absolutely make some ice cream sandwiches. It helps too if you assemble the sandwiches and stick them back in the freezer for a bit so they don\u2019t become a melty mess. :) \u2665 Teri Salty Nuts Ice Cream Makes 1 quart

VToday we have a recipe for you courtesy of  Adrianna Adarme  and her new book  PANCAKES!!!  This book is made for pancake lovers / breakfast lovers, and has 72 awesome recipes for pancakes of all kinds. While Pancakes has mostly breakfast pancake recipes (duh), she also has a entire section dedicated to dinner pancakes which is pretty cool.

This recipe is for the huaraches, so you can add whatever toppings you like and it will be delicious. We added carnitas, iceberg lettuce, queso fresco, tomatoes, cilantro, and lime juice. Done. Easy. Delicious. We are giving away one copy of  Pancakes  to a random person who comments on this post and tells us what their favorite way to eat pancakes are. You gotta remember to write your email in the email field so we can get a hold of you if you are the winner. We are taking entrants from now till Monday at 8am.

p9238
aV1. In a medium bowl, mix together the masa, salt, and warm water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes.\u000a
p9239
aV2. Add the refried beans to a bowl of a food processor and pulse until the beans become a paste. Alternatively, you could mash them with a fork.\u000a
p9240
aV3. Separate the dough into 4 balls. Roll each ball into an oval shape. Using for thumb, make a long, deep well in the center. It will resemble the shape of a cigar. Place 1 scant teaspoon of the beans into the well. Pinch the cavity closed, enclosing the beans completely.\u000a
p9241
aV4. One at a time place each piece of filled dough between two pieces of plastic wrap, Using a rolling pin, lightly press into a 4-inch-long oval that is 1/4-inch thick.\u000a
p9242
aV5. Preheat your skillet over medium-high heat and brush with 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oiol. Add the huaraches and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, flipping when lightly golden brown. Continue until all 4 huaches are cooked. Remove from skillet and set aside.\u000a
p9243
aV6. Place the skillet over medium-high heat, and pour in vegetable oil until it reaches 1/2 inch up the sides. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the huaraches to the pan and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown on each side. Gently turn and cook on the opposite side for 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve hot.\u000a

VHi Guys! Guess what? Spoon Fork Bacon turns 2 today! We\u2019re celebrating with a classic cake, devil\u2019s food. We\u2019ve been craving something rich and decadent and this cake really hit the spot. My favorite part about it though is the real fruit frosting! With berry season coming to an end, I\u2019ve been trying to do what everyone has been doing, jamming fresh berries (and stone fruit) into everything I possibly can. I love that you can really taste the strawberries in this frosting and that it\u2019s pretty easy to whip up. One piece of advice, don\u2019t add more of the strawberry puree into the frosting until the previous amount has been fully incorporated into the mixture. The consistency becomes a little gritty and wet if you rush this. Thank you all so much for your wonderful support throughout the last two years. Teri and I have had so much fun creating beautiful and delicious recipes/images for you all and look forward to continue banging out awesome stuff! Your comments/likes/pins/tweets\u2026( all of it!) really help to drive our creativity and we appreciate the honest feedback! Anyway, we hope everyone has an awesome weekend (we\u2019re taking tomorrow off!), doing fun things with loved ones! Enjoy! xx, Jenny **Another small tip for the frosting is to add 1 tablespoon of milk powder to the puree before incorporating it into the butter and sugar. This will help to absorb some of the moisture without taking away the pink color! Devils Food Cake with Real Strawberry Frosting Makes 1 (8\u201d) cake

VHi Guys! Today we have these jalapeno and cheddar cornmeal biscuits! I love a jalapeno-cheddar combo, cornmeal and biscuits so these little guys just made sense to me. I usually like replacing some or all of the butter in biscuit recipes with healthier options like greek yogurt and mashed sweet potatoes, but sometimes you just need a fatty biscuit. So today here you go, a cheesy, crusty, fatty biscuit! The addition of cornmeal to the mix is nice because it changes the texture. Giving you a crispier crust, but still leaves the inside buttery and soft. The perfect biscuit. You can scale the cheddar and jalapeno up or down to your liking, but as the boyfriend noticed you get the taste of jalapenos in this recipe without the heat, so if you\u2019re not a spicy type of person these biscuits should still be okay. You can use these guys to build delicious breakfast sandwiches or use them to dunk into hot (or cold) soup or eat them the way I like best, slightly warmed with a drizzle of honey\u2026.as I stand hovered over my kitchen sink devouring biscuit after biscuit, but I digress. I hope everyone has a great holiday weekend! xx, Jenny Jalapeno and Cheddar Cornmeal Biscuits Makes 10 to 12

VHi Guys!
p9403
aVToday we have these jalapeno and cheddar cornmeal biscuits!
p9404
aVI love a jalapeno-cheddar combo, cornmeal and biscuits so these little guys just made sense to me.
p9405
aVI usually like replacing some or all of the butter in biscuit recipes with healthier options like greek yogurt and mashed sweet potatoes, but sometimes you just need a fatty biscuit.
p9406
aVSo today here you go, a cheesy, crusty, fatty biscuit!

VWow. It\u2019s so hot in LA. I just got back from a little Labor Day trip over to Vancouver. My boyfriend (John) and I did a lot of activities. We went whale watching where we were basically on a boat that drove the Seattle and back where we saw Orcas in America. So that was funny. We went fishing for Salmon and didn\u2019t catch anything, which was a bummer. We ate food, met internet friends (Hi  Sheena! ), and rode bikes. It was such great weather most of the time. Then I come home to this gross hotness that is LA. Ugh. Not fun at all. Where I grew up (Boise) we had quite the hot summers as well. Popsicles from Costco were always in the freezer, especially the yogurt kind. My favorite. Some people don\u2019t like the texture as much (ahehm Jenny), but I freaking love it! These Raspberry and Coconut popsicles make a wonderful creamy frozen treat. The coconut we used is shredded so it doesn\u2019t get break your teeth hard when it\u2019s frozen. You could also sub out the raspberries for something else if you prefer. Keep cool! \u2665 Teri Raspberry-Coconut Popsicles Makes 10 to 12

VI don\u2019t bake enough delicious breakfast dishes on the weekends. I had my fling with baked oatmeal, and then savory bread pudding, but now I feel like there hasn\u2019t been another \u2018thing\u2019 to get me excited about mustering up the energy on a Sunday morning to put effort into baking. That was until I realized I actually liked crumb cake. My mom owned a coffee cart in the airport where I grew up. We had ginormous coffee bags delivered to the house every other day. They sat in the front near the door until she took them to work. As a child I thought coffee was gross, and I thought it stunk. The whole house constantly smelled like coffee, and I smelled like coffee. I hated it. I also ate a lot of what I thought were chocolate covered raisins which turned out to be chocolate covered coffee beans. I was under the impression that crumb cake only ever meant coffee crumb cake. So crumb cake was always something I never thought I would like. Even as an adult I don\u2019t really like coffee up in my stuff unless I am actually drinking coffee. So when I realized how much of a naïve dumb dumb I was being about crumb cakes, I tried this Blueberry and Cardamom Crumb Cake and was like whoa. Ok. I like crumb cake. That\u2019s neat. That means it is another delicious baking breakfast dish that needs to be experimented with. Yay. This should probably be added to your Sunday baking situations, it is to mine.  \u2665 Teri Blueberry Cardamom Crumb Cake Makes 1 (8\u201dx8\u201d)

VHi Guys! We\u2019re finishing the week with a couple of huge meatball subs, using our  marinara sauce  from Wednesday, which was made with the boldly delicious  Troublemaker wine . I LOVE a good meatball sub and have been pretty obsessed with the one at Bay City Deli in Santa Monica for the past 4 years. It\u2019s so freakin\u2019 good. One thing I\u2019m not a fan of is waiting in line for an hour just to order the sub. The solution, make one myself. (in dire times like these, finding another suitable location could take days, if not weeks to find\u2026.meh, maybe I\u2019m being a tad bit dramatic..and now I ramble\u2026whatever) ANYWAY, we used an awesome beef blend from  Flannery Beef . (also my favorite website to order and send fabulous meat gifts to loved ones!) They offer a really fun, \u201cbuild a burger\u2019 on their website. You customize your own ground beef blend, up to 4 different kinds, and they freshly grind your handpicked blend for you before shipping it off! Everything is super fresh and it\u2019s fun to be able to pick and choose your burger blend to you own liking and taste. Last week we offered a few picnic recipes, along with a fun picnic roundup and I think this sub would be a perfect addition. The way the marinara sauce just soaks into the soft, butter baguette, yet is secured by the toasted crust makes for a perfect traveling sandwich. While this sub is awesome piping hot, I\u2019ve been just as happy eating it straight from the fridge\u2026sort of like cold pizza\u2026it\u2019s all good. I hope everyone has an awesome weekend filled with lots of meatball \u201csub-age\u201d! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Mega Meatball Sub Makes 2 (12 inch subs)

VHi Guys! Today with have these fun Peanut Butter & Jelly and Potato Chip Bars. These bars are a throwback to the classic pb&j sandwich. Pb&j sandwiches just scream childhood (well and actually college too) to me and I feel like I\u2019ve rarely, if ever eaten a pb&j sandwich without stuffing a bunch of potato chips into it first.  Who was the first person to think of doing that? I\u2019d like to give them a hug and thank them for creating an incredible combo of flavors. These guys are pretty easy to whip up. After you make the peanut butter dough it pretty much becomes all about layering\u2026.super simple! For some reason these also remind me of the fall and staying cozy. I\u2019m totally ready for fall, cool weather and cute cold weather clothes\u2026enough with the heat already! Anyway, the next time you\u2019re in the mood to bake something like brownies or cookies think about baking these Peanut Butter & Jelly and Potato Chip Bars instead\u2026something a little different, that\u2019s totally delicious. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Peanut Butter, Jelly and Potato Chip Bars Makes 1 (9\u201dx12\u201d) pan

V You guys are so nice. I can\u2019t even being to tell you how much I appreciate all your nice comments about my senior cat. I love you guys! This weekend I spent a lot of time cuddling and loving on my cat. I also did some retail therapy, which included some handmade shoes and amazing new plates to add to my collection. I also spent a lot of time watching master chef and repeating the cute little kid at the end that says \u201cone potato two potato.\u201d So that was fun. I also went to the farmers market and bought too much stuff like I do every weekend. I always think I will eat more than I actually do. My eyes are way bigger than my stomach apparently. I hate wasting food, which is why we made this simple little recipe from Black Plum Preserves. Two ingredients, no pectin, and lots of deliciousness. We are probably going to post another recipe using this Black Plum Preserves. Yum. I also wanted to share this BEAUTIFUL knife  New West Knife Works  gave us. I was the one who got to take it home (yay me!) because all my knifes are old and have never been sharpened. New knifes are mind blowing when you have been cutting dull ones. This knife is like something I have always wanted, a mini kitchen light saber. Bonus: they are all sustainable and made in the USA. So that\u2019s pretty neat. Hope you all had a great weekend, and enjoy this Black Plum Preserves recipe! *We were graciously gifted a knife from New West Knife Works, but we shared this knife with you because we actually like it.* Black Plum Preserves Makes about 1 quart

VWe made this cute tart for you to make to celebrate life with. It\u2019s a Red Apricot and Sweet Cherry Tart with a Cashew Frangipane. We invite you to welcome in autumn and say bye bye to summer with this tart. We decided to use these gorgeous Red Velvet Apricots, or plum-cots. These apricots have a beautiful deep red skin with rich golden flesh. Their texture is very much plum like with the taste of both apricots and plum, hence the name plum-cots. If you can\u2019t find these it\u2019s ok, you can sub for regular apricots or even plums. We love the sweet and tart flavor the Red Apricots give this tart, which is a really nice compliment to the rich and nutty baked cashew custard. We also used sweet cherries to add a just a touch more of autumn. We surrounded all of this goodness with a simple shortbread crust. This really is autumn in a tart, and we hope you will enjoy it! \u2665 Teri Red Apricot and Sweet Cherry Tart with a Cashew Frangipane  Makes 1 (10 inch) tart

VHi Guys! Is anyone participating in fantasy football? I am. I know, it\u2019s weird. I feel weird about it. This is my first time ever and I really have no idea what I\u2019m doing. (boyfriend may have even picked all my players for me during the draft\u2026that\u2019s cool, right?) Truth is some old college friends and I decided to start a league together this year. Even though I know absolutely nothing about football and this whole fantasy thing is super confusing to me, I love that I\u2019m doing it with my most vulgar, sh*t talking, hilarious, loud, witty group of girlfriends. It really makes this \u201cgame\u201d a lot more interesting and reminds me how lucky I am to have such amazing women in my life. Anyway, because football season is here I thought something fun like burgers would be appropriate, but since I\u2019ve been trying to add a little more health and dietary balance into my life they would have to be veggie burgers\u2026delicious Big Veg Quinoa Burgers. Although the name of this burger is a play off the not so delicious Big Mac, the inspiration is really the In-N Out burger, special sauce and all! I really, really love these patties and was super excited that it got the double thumbs up from my not so veggie patty friendly boyfriend. They\u2019re a real mouthful and totally filled with lots of flavor. We used pretzel buns here because I like the heartiness, but swap it out for whichever you like. I\u2019m also a huge fan of eating this burger protein style, wrapped in crisp, cold lettuce\u2026 so freakin\u2019 good, you guys! If you want to get even more healthy, you can skip out on the basic thousand island dressing, but I personally thinks it gives it burger that slight In-N-Out taste. Makes 4

VHi Guys! Fall is finally here!!! We\u2019re starting this season off right with cozy biscuits\u2026cheesy beet biscuits to be exact! I love coloring foods with beets, it\u2019s so easy, natural and the results are always so stunning. You can taste a slight earthiness to these biscuits, but the buttery, flaky, cheesy goodness of the comte cheese is the predominant flavor. I\u2019ve been on a pretty crazy job this last week and things aren\u2019t really going to slow down for me anytime soon. I can\u2019t complain though\u2026although I do long for a night where I get more than 3 hours of sleep, but in the end it\u2019ll all be worth it! When I\u2019m feeling highly stressed, like right now, it\u2019s so funny how something as simple as a warm and delicious biscuit can turn your whole day around. You know those stress balls people squeeze in their hands? Well these are my stress biscuits. **Eat one every 4 to 6 hours or as needed to reduce stress and satisfy hunger pangs\u2026.then thank me later. ;) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Cheesy Beet Biscuits Makes 10-12

VWe have been posting lots of desserts lately. It\u2019s making me a little sweets crazy. I try and keep copious amounts of sweets out of my house because I know what will happen. If I know there are sweets in the house, I basically just think about them all day until I no longer have the strength to stay away and then eat it all. Last night I was watching Newsroom with John (BF) and he came back into the room with mint chocolate covered pretzels to share. Sneaky, because where the hell did those come from and how come I didn\u2019t know they existed till now? Have you guys had mint chocolate covered pretzels? It\u2019s like a thin mint only better because of the salt! It\u2019s gonna become my new favorite. So the other sweet I wanna talk about today are these Individual Apple Crisps. First I want to talk about how great individual sizes are. For someone who has a boyfriend who takes bites that are like 5 times the size of my normal bites, I appreciate that it is very clear that this is my portion and that is your portion. You get what I am saying? Second you can have your eaters put whatever else on it they want. Like ice cream AND caramel sauce, whipped cream, or anything. These would be so perfect for Thanksgiving, or fall dinner parties. Cute stuff. Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Individual Apple Crisps a La Mode Makes 4

VHi Guys! Did everyone have a good long weekend? The boyfriend and I took it easy this weekend and went on a couple beach hikes, grilled a little and spent Labor Day celebrating our 3 year anniversary\u2026dog adopting anniversary that is. :) Yep, 3 years ago on Labor day we brought home, Dexter, who would soon become the love of our lives. We like to call him our \u201cLittle Sangria Pup\u201d because we adopted our beautiful mutt while buzzed off of way too much Sangria at Fiesta Hermosa (a Memorial and Labor Day beach festival in Hermosa beach with craft and food vendors, live music, etc.). There was animal adoption booth at the festival and of course I had to drag Jordan over to the pups to take a look. It was actually the boyfriend that locked eyes with him and determined that Dexter would be coming home with us that evening. I was thrilled!!!!!!\u2026 and now he basically runs our lives\u2026and we love it. Anyway, back to today\u2019s recipe. Unfortunately its been so disgustingly hot out that I haven\u2019t been able to bake these muffins in a little while, but I do love these big ol\u2019 Giant Roasted Grape Muffins. Grapes have become one of my favorite fruits to roast. There\u2019s so much sugar in them that they practically turn into candy when roasted. Delicious! (although this also means you need to be careful not to burn them and your baking sheet while roasting them) The muffins themselves are great; large, moist, fluffy with a great cake-y texture. You can really add anything to them depending on your preference\u2026blueberries, currants, chocolate chips, bananas, poppy seeds, really whatever you want! I chose the roasted grapes because I love the flavor and like I said earlier, I\u2019m digging roasted grapes at the moment.

VIt\u2019s Sweet Potato Smoothie time! This is one of those recipes you should use when you buy stuff for dinner and then never actually make dinner and order pizza instead. We have all been there, and being a big fan of potatoes I always purchase them. I like to imagine making fluffy mashed potatoes, tater tots, a gratin; you know something that will be a delicious way to consume carbs. Sadly, there are times when I come home and the last thing I want to do is turn the oven or stove on. I can however handle turning on my vitamix to make delicious and amazing smoothies. So with this simple Sweet Potato Smoothie recipe you can use leftover sweet potatoes that were possibly once destined for carb indulging side dishes.  You can slurp this smoothie down for breakfast or dessert or anytime. God, I love smoothies. \u2665 Teri Sweet Potato Smoothie Make 2

VDo you guys watch New Girl? I just started it and I am trying really hard to get Jenny to watch it because I feel like it\u2019s the modern day version of Friends. We all know how much Jenny loved Friends. I think I am in love with Schmidt, because he just talks about food all the time. Every show I watch I fall in love with one character. On Friends it was Ross, That 70\u2032s Show it was Eric, News Room it\u2019s Jim AND Neal. Do you guys get crushes on people that are in shows you watch? I am so curious. I feel like Schmidt from New Girl would totally approve of this Basic Pavlova with Macerated Berries recipe we have for you today. Have you ever had pavlova? Just by looking at it I thought I wouldn\u2019t like it so much. I thought it would be like eating chalk with berries on top. The inside of the pavlova is actually cake-y and light and fluffy. My favorite part of the process of baking this is that when it\u2019s out of the oven and beautiful and perfect, then you ruin it by smacking the top with a spoon and breaking it. That part is the best, and also allows the berries and their juices to seep in and create a beautiful delicious mess. It\u2019s crazy how easy this is to make, and it is so impressive looking. Think about it the next time you have to make dessert for people! \u2665 Teri Basic Pavlova with Macerated Berries Makes 1

VThis is one of my favorite doughnut situations we have ever posted. I am very excited about it because it is what I have always wanted in an apple fritter. Let me start off first by saying that apple fritters are one of my favorite things to get at the doughnut shop. I especially flip over them if they have just been made and are still warm. There are a few things that I really don\u2019t like about some places that make them. First is too much cinnamon. Apple Fritters are not cinnamon rolls, so chill on the cinnamon please. Some places are super stingy on their apple filling. It\u2019s shocking because it most likely came from the can, like the weird apple and cherry pie filling you can get at the market. So why be stingy with it? Fill it up! I want it in every nook and cranny! That is what makes these Apple Fritter Rings perfect. The apple the dough ratio is pretty much set, so you know you\u2019re going to get warm apple in every bite. Awesome. We took a chill pill when it came to cinnamon, I think this is important. We made our glaze with real vanilla beans, so it tastes like magic. We also made these Apple Fritter Rings with  Sweet Tango  apples. Sweet Tangos  are a hybrid of Honeycrisps and Zestars. It\u2019s the lovechild of two amazing apples, so you know it has to be good. They are only available a couple of months in the fall so go out and get some right this second! These apples are so crispy and snappy, and perfect to cook with or just eat straight up. A quick note to let you know that Sweet Tango has a c ontest right now for a trip for two to LA to have dinner at Animal.  We love eating at Animal, and always recommend it when people ask us where to eat in LA. Stay warm and enjoy these Apple Fritter Rings! \u2665 Teri Apple Ring Fritters Serves 8 to 12 * This post was sponsored by  Sweet Tango.  All of our opinions are our own.

VI am very happy to report that it is kind of raining here in LA. For those of you that don\u2019t know, LA is always sunny and nice. Sometimes, especially lately, it\u2019s been too hot. So this rain is such a nice break. I realized last night that the nice weather here all the time is just too much. Although I don\u2019t want it to snow or anything (lets not get crazy), I do wish there were more seasons. Los Angeles transforms into this super romantic please when it rains, and I wish that happened more. The smell after rain is so fresh and different. You don\u2019t see as many people on the streets, and it becomes quite and very eerily calm. Everything is so much more green and alive. I feel more alive, even if that means I am laying in bed watching the rain dripping down my window and cuddling with cats, or watching Friends episodes and trying decide which character I am most (I think it\u2019s Phoebe). It\u2019s rainy days like these that make the kitchen seem like a great place to spend time in. I don\u2019t know what it is about the rain, but I think it strikes some kind of natural urge in all of us to eat something cozy, something fortifying. I would like to suggest our Almond Butter Soba Noodles with Garlic Shrimp. This dish is really filling and different than what might first pop into your mind when you think of cold weather food. You might first think of using peanut butter in this dish, but the almond butter gives it a lighter feel and a creamier texture. The garlic shrimp are delicious and gives this dish a bite. I would give this dish an A+ for being a great rain weather choice. \u2665 Teri Almond Butter Soba Noodles with Garlic Shrimp Serves 2

VHi Guys! Today we have homemade harissa for you! Harissa is a spicy North African (although there are a number of varieties from all over) condiment that has a wonderful flavor. You can add it to pretty much whatever you want. I love stirring a little bit into my soups or even infusing a little bit into some of my sauces to give it a unique kick. Since I was a little girl I\u2019ve been fascinated with DIY cooking projects at home. I just find them very interesting, exciting and I love the whole \u201clabor of love\u201d thing, I really do. I feel accomplished when I tackle things like kimchi, ketchup, whole grain mustard, sausages, bacon, etc. There\u2019s not too much that excites me more than being able to uncover and rinse something like my own my side of freshly cured pork belly after days and days of waiting, adjusting and waiting again. I think this is all because my mom made everything from scratch growing up and condiments was up there on her list. Although they were usually Korean foods/condiments she was making from scratch, I think it just gave me an overall itch to get my own DIY juices flowing. Anyway, that takes us back to this harissa. I learned about this tasty condiment for the first time in culinary school, about 6 years ago, and have been in love ever since. Today we have two versions for you; I call them \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cspicy\u201d, but just a fair warning that they\u2019re both quite spicy. One is just a thicker, more authentic North African kind of paste (the \u201cspicy\u201d), while the other is toned down with a roasted bell pepper and a bit more sauce-like. Another thing to mention is that I use ground spices for one of the recipes while instructing to use whole spices and to grind them yourself for the other recipe. You can use pre-ground spices for both if you want, no problem! I just included super basic instructions for both incase some people prefer to toast and grind there own spices\u2026like me! Want to know the best thing about this condiment? It\u2019s actually not a \u201clabor of love\u201d, it\u2019s totally easy and you still get to feel very accomplished as you spoon your harissa into little jars. With the holidays right around the corner, can you think of anyone special in your life that might want a delicious jar of homemade harissa?\u2026maybe, yes?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Homemade Harissa Two Ways Makes 1 cup each

VWe have a quick little recipe or you today for Brown Butter Biscuits. Love these little duded. The browned butter gives an amazing depth of flavor that you just can\u2019t get any other way. These little biscuits would be great for Thanksgiving, or just morning time with honey and jam! Are you all getting your Thanksgiving preparations together? How is that going? Stressful I bet. Last time I made Thanksgiving, the grocery list made me want to throw up. So long. If you guys need any last minute recipes be sure to check out our Thanksgiving section on the site! Hope you all will enjoy your sliver of time off for the holiday, and eat lots of good food! \u2665 Teri Browned Butter Biscuits Makes 10 to 12

VHi Guys! Today we have a fun recipe for you all\u2026DIY pasta WITH four flavor variations and drying instructions! I really like making my own pasta (part of the DIY food obsession I have that I mentioned earlier this week), but it\u2019s definitely a labor of love. These days I\u2019m lucky enough to have a stand mixer to mix and bring my dough together, plus fancy pasta attachments to easily roll and cut my dough without having to demonstrate my pathetic arm strength, but these things are totally not necessary to make wonderful pasta at home! We use a blend of all purpose and semolina flours because I like the firm texture the semolina adds to the dough and overall final product and all purpose flour is usually something everyone has on hand. You can get all authentic and serious if you want and pick up or order (via the internets) some \u201c00 flour\u201d (doppio zero flour) which is an Italian flour that is is great for pasta and pizza doughs because of its fine texture, which when used results in a silky, supple dough. I have used it a couple times (specifically ones with lower protein %, because I blend my flour with semolina) and did quite enjoy it, but again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to go out of your way to find and buy \u201c00 flour\u201d (which can be rather expensive) if you just want to make a quick dough. There are many purists out there who would disagree with me so it\u2019s really up to you! We included basic drying instructions because I began to notice that almost every time I would make my own pasta, I was unable to use the entire ball of dough quick enough, before it would go bad. I like using the hang dry method over the nesting method because I like the thorough and even drying you achieve where as with the nesting method it\u2019s easier to develop mold due to improper \u201ccoiling\u201d and unseen wet spots. If you don\u2019t have a pasta drying rack, you can always use wire hangers, which is what I did for a couple years before finally investing $20 into a wooden drying rack. Now go make some scratch pasta! Okay? Maybe?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Homemade Pasta Dough (with variations) Makes about 1 lb. dough

p10631
aV1. For dough: In a mixing bowl combine flours and whisk together. On a clean work surface or in a bowl place 1 1/2 cups of flour mixture in a mound. Make a well in the center of flour and crack eggs into well, followed by oil.\u000a
p10632
aV2. Using a fork gently whisk eggs and oil together while slowly incorporating flour. Once flour and eggs are combined, add more flour little by little to form a ball that is no longer sticky to touch.\u000a
p10633
aV3. If dough is dry add water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Knead dough for 8-10 minutes (dough should feel very tight and should bounce back when gently pressed), wrap in plastic and let sit for about 20 minutes before using. Follow pasta machine instructions for rolling out the dough and cutting into desired pasta type (or roll pasta dough by hand with a rolling pin until very thin and cut into desired pasta type, using a clean ruler for even noodles).\u000a
p10634
aV4. To color dough: Add \u201cflavors\u201d to eggs beat together before adding mixture to well of flour mixture. Continue following basic pasta dough instructions.\u000a
p10635
aV5. To dry: Line freshly cut pasta dough onto a pasta dry rack (or onto clean wire hangers), in a single layer and allow pasta to dry in a cool, dry place for 24 hours. Carefully remove pasta from drying rack and store in an airtight container or jar until ready to use. Dry pasta will hold for up to 1 month if stored in a cool, dry place.\u000a

VThis holiday season we want you to jump into the kitchen, get creative and find inspiration in unsuspecting places. We love using these super decadent truffles from the  GODIVA Holiday Truffle Collection  because they have unique flavors like Gingerbread, Cranberry, and Raspberry Linzer in our holiday \u201cTruffled Croquembouche\u201d. It\u2019s hard to think of too many other holiday sweets/edible decor that scream holiday as much as a croquembouche, but this time we thought adding a couple GODIVA truffles would give the tree an elegant and extra delicious finish. Not only do these make great centerpieces, but you can also give them away as hostess gifts, along with a full box of truffles! They\u2019re super cute and much easier to put together than you would expect; don\u2019t be intimidated by having to melt sugar, it\u2019s not hard at all. Plus, cleaning up is easy too! Just fill the sugared pot with water and place the sugared whisk into the pot. Place the pot over medium-high heat and boil for 15 to 20 minutes or until the sugar dissolves. The next time you think about going to the market to buy fresh flowers for your next get together, think about throwing together this deliciously, decadent Truffled Croquembouche; not only are edible centerpieces fun for both you and your guests, but you get to snack on the divine GODIVA truffles as you build your fancy croquembouche! xx, Jenny Truffled Croquembouche Serves 5 to 6

VDirections:\u000a
p10691
aV1. Preheat oven to 400°F.\u000a
p10692
aV2. Place water, butter and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.\u000a
p10693
aV3. Add flour and stir with a wooden spoon 3 minutes or until a sticky dough forms. Pour dough into a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and beat for 2 minutes to release some steam. Add eggs one at a time, mixing and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.\u000a
p10694
aV4. Scoop dough into a piping bag fitted with a round tip (Ateco #806) and pipe 1/2 tablespoon sized balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until puffs have puffed and turned golden brown. Allow puffs to cool slightly before poking holes in the sides to release the steam. Place puffs back onto the baking sheet and allow to dry out in a warm oven for about 15 minutes.\u000a
p10695
aV5. Once puffs have cooled completely melt together sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water. Bring mixture to a boil and using a candy thermometer, boil sugar until 240\u02daF has been reached.\u000a
p10696
aV6. Remove from heat and allow sugar to cool slightly. Spray a sheet of parchment with cooking spray and use as a surface.\u000a
p10697
aV7. Carefully dip a puff into the melted sugar and stick onto another puff. Continue to do so until a 6 inch disc has been made.\u000a
p10698
aV8. Begin creating a cone, using the disc as a base, incorporating the truffles randomly throughout the tree (be careful when using the sugar against the truffles as too much will make them melt excessively).\u000a
p10699
aV9. Once a small tree has been made, set aside and dry while a sugar nest is made.\u000a
p10700
aV10. Cut the rounded 1 inch end of a whisk with wire cutters and carefully discard loose pieces. Line a 9\u201dx13\u201d baking dish with parchment and lightly coat with cooking spray.\u000a
p10701
aV11. Place sugar back over heat and melt until mixture reaches 240\u02daF (add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed).\u000a
p10702
aV12. Place altered whisk into mixture and whisk. Allow thicker drops of sugar fall before quickly placing the whisk over the prepared baking dish and shaking the whisk back and forth until a long \u201cnest\u201d has formed.\u000a
p10703
aV13. Gently take the ends of the \u201cnest\u201d and place it around the truffled tree to create a sash and allow the sugar to set.\u000a
p10704
aV14. Use croquembouche as centerpiece for your next holiday party.\u000a

VWe love using these super decadent truffles from the  GODIVA Holiday Truffle Collection  because they have unique flavors like Gingerbread, Cranberry, and Raspberry Linzer in our holiday \u201cTruffled Croquembouche\u201d.
p10707
aVIt\u2019s hard to think of too many other holiday sweets/edible decor that scream holiday as much as a croquembouche, but this time we thought adding a couple GODIVA truffles would give the tree an elegant and extra delicious finish.
p10708
aVNot only do these make great centerpieces, but you can also give them away as hostess gifts, along with a full box of truffles!
p10709
aVThey\u2019re super cute and much easier to put together than you would expect; don\u2019t be intimidated by having to melt sugar, it\u2019s not hard at all.

aVJust fill the sugared pot with water and place the sugared whisk into the pot.

VToday we have another fun little DIY holiday gift for you. This one is a personal favorite for us because we would both LOVE to get this. Jenny and I have a thing for champagne and especially adding a little something extra. Which is why we thought making a trio Homemade Champagne Simple Syrups to gift with these beautiful  Perrier-Jouët InBloom Fresh Boxes  was a great idea. These simple syrups are so great because you can add them to champagne, or nearly any cocktail drink to quickly and easily fancy it up. We made three flavors: sweet rose, ginger pear, and honey lavender. You could make one or all three to gift with these Perrier-Jouët InBloom Fresh Boxes. We designed these labels with the Fresh Bloom Boxes in mind because together they just make such an amazing hostess gift. Lets talk about how to do this. Here is what you need: 1. Bottles.  We like these Wheaton 8oz bottles. 2. Label designs in  PINK  and  GREEN 3.  Avery Oval Labels 4. Gift Boxes 5.  Pink Tissue Paper  or  Green Tissue Paper 6.  Twine 7. Scissors 8. Tape 9. Make the recipe below for the simple syrups The easiest thing to do is to download the label design in the color of your choice and go to avery.com/print to upload and print your labels. We just packaged them in our box and wrapped them in tissue paper to match the bloom box type we choose. You can purchase the bloom boxes online  here.  Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Flavored Simple Syrups Honey-Lavender: *This post was sponsored by Perrier-Jouët. Thank you for supporting our sponsors! It helps us keep going!*

VHi Guys! Today we have a healthy meatless Monday recipe for you all; a simple and versatile Vegan Cauliflower Cream Sauce! Teri and I recently finished shooting a couple paleo and vegan cookbooks and the experience has totally inspired me to play around in the kitchen and try my hand at a few vegan and paleo friendly recipes myself.  First up is this \u201ccream\u201d sauce. We tossed our sauce with pasta to make a quick and satisfying meal (that won\u2019t weight you down!), but you can also use this as a sauce paired with different cooked proteins and even as a dipping sauce for veggies, both fresh and steamed! I\u2019m not going to try and convince you that this sauce tastes exactly like an alfredo sauce or a full fat cream sauce because it totally doesn\u2019t. I will say that it\u2019s a wonderful healthy alternative for when you\u2019re getting a hankering for something rich and creamy, but don\u2019t want to compromise your waistline.  I like to have meals like this a few times a week, especially during the chilly fall and winter months when all I\u2019m craving is rich, creamy, decadent foods but don\u2019t want to gain 100 pounds by next spring! I\u2019m no vegan cooking expert, not by a long shot ,and I know that it can be intimidating but I think this recipe is a great intro recipe to vegan cooking. It only has a few ingredients and is really easy to throw together. Plus you can adjust the ingredient amounts according to your own personal taste. Can\u2019t find nutritional yeast or just not into it? No problem, just sub it out for any cheese alternative of your choice! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Vegan Cauliflower Cream Sauce Makes 2 cups

VHappy New Year! You may or may not be as hung over as we are right about now. There are a couple of things that really help us out when we feel horrible after a night of celebration. One of them is our  Bloody Mary  recipe, and the other are Green Smoothies. We made this Green Smoothie with one of our most favorite kitchen appliances ever: A Vitamix. If you are in the market for a blender, we highly recommend it. It pulverizes everything like nothing else. This is one of my favorite recipes for a Green Smoothie because of the pineapple. I can\u2019t take a straight up Green Smoothie that tastes like you\u2019re drinking grass, so the addition of the pineapple really does the deed in this smoothie.

VHi Guys! Today we have some quick and easy apple-cinnamon pancakes with the most decadent of syrup\u2026.a brown sugar-buttermilk syrup. I feel almost wrong for calling this syrup as it should really be called \u2018buttermilk caramel-awesome sauce\u2019, but for breakfast purposes we\u2019re just going to call it syrup..seems much more appropriate. Anyway, these pancakes could be the perfect thing to wake up to New Years Day! After a long night of drinking, aren\u2019t you supposed to carb load anyway, to soak up all the booze? So along with being super indulgent and delicious these pancakes are kind of like a hangover cure\u2026kind of. If you don\u2019t booze it up on New Years Eve, I think it\u2019s still okay to scarf a few dozen of these down\u2026I actually highly encourage it. If you\u2019re going the healthy resolution route this New Years, don\u2019t worry: 1) You still have a couple days to go to town on dish 2) We have a healthy \u201cdetox-ish\u201d drink coming \u2018atcha a little later this week! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Apple Cinnamon Pancakes with Brown Sugar Buttermilk Syrup Serves 4 to 5

VDirections:\u000a
p10942
aV1. For buttermilk syrup: Melt butter in medium pot (should be a tall pot). Once butter has melted, add both sugars and water to the pot and stir until all sugar is well coated, then stir in buttermilk.\u000a
p10943
aV2. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove mixture from heat and add baking soda (be very careful as the mixture will bubble up). Once baking soda has been added, stir the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes until it begins to settle. Stir in vanilla and salt until fully incorporated. Pour syrup into a small carafe and set aside until ready to use.\u000a
p10944
aV3. For pancakes: Place flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Add buttermilk, eggs and butter and stir with fork until mixture has just come together and no dry pockets remain. Fold in apples until just combined.\u000a
p10945
aV4. Melt 2 tablespoons butter onto a griddle, in a cast iron pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/3 cup batter onto the buttered pan and allow pancakes to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Once you see the edges begin to cook and air bubbles popping on the surface, flip pancakes and cook for an additional 3 minutes.\u000a
p10946
aV5. Transfer finished pancakes onto a baking sheet (you can keep finished pancakes in a warm [200\u02daF] oven while the remaining pancakes cook) and repeat until all the batter has been used.\u000a
p10947
aV6. Serve pancakes with the brown sugar, buttermilk syrup and more butter, if desired.\u000a

VHi Guys!
p10950
aVToday we have some quick and easy apple-cinnamon pancakes with the most decadent of syrup\u2026.a brown sugar-buttermilk syrup.
p10951
aVI feel almost wrong for calling this syrup as it should really be called \u2018buttermilk caramel-awesome sauce\u2019, but for breakfast purposes we\u2019re just going to call it syrup..seems much more appropriate.
p10952
aVAnyway, these pancakes could be the perfect thing to wake up to New Years Day!

V Hi Guys! Today we have Brie Filled Baklava for you! Every now and then, while my boyfriend and I are out getting a bite to eat he tastes something that tugs at his heart strings and he says to me with such deep passion, \u201cBLOG-WORTHY\u201d, which always makes me giggle. This happened a few months ago when we were out getting some pizza. We ordered these spinach and cheese stuffed \u201cpinwheels\u201d my boyfriend got this crazed look in eyes and a couple of days later, after I did a couple tests in the kitchen, there were  Pizza Wheels Today\u2019s recipe is the result of another Jordan \u201cBLOG-WORTHY\u201d freak out! As a lover of baklava, he has to have a piece every time we run across some, and this time was no different. Except this time when he took a bite he was unexpectedly, but very pleasantly surprised to find a nice layer of rich and creamy cheese in the center! Neither of us have ever seen this before but it makes total sense! How could creamy cheese not go well with flaky, crispy crust, sweet honey, and toasty nuts?! I\u2019m not quite sure it was brie that the restaurant was using, but it seemed to make the most sense to me so that\u2019s what we\u2019re using today for our own baklava! Just a bit of layering, brushing and sprinkling involved in this recipe. So easy and they\u2019re so delicious! So go make them and share them, because everyone deserves a little Brie Filled Baklava in their lives. ;) xx, Jenny Brie Filled Baklava Makes 1 (9\u201dx13\u201d) pan

VHi! I\u2019m back from Tokyo trip, jet lagged and all, totally missing all the amazing food I ate. I\u2019m thinking about writing a little travel post of my experience, but we shall see! Getting back into the swing of things has been really difficult. I\u2019m going to bed super late, and waking up really early, and I generally feel weird. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s me missing Tokyo, or the weird mental state no sleep is giving me, but either way I hope to be back to normal soon. My favorite part of Tokyo was the ramen. SO. MUCH. RAMEN. So salty, so delicious. I think this is the reason I came home with swollen ankles. I felt like a sausage. Since being back I\u2019ve been craving some sweets, so we decided to make this really chocolate to the extreme pound cake. This is our first of a series of posts with  Almond Breeze,  and we are so excited to create some great recipes with it. This Double Chocolate Pound is really easy to prepare, and the Vanilla Orange Glaze that you pour on top makes this chocolate pound just a little more special, and pretty. Enjoy!

VDid everyone have a good Christmas? I was in Idaho, where it wasn\u2019t as cold as I would have thought. There was snow on the ground, but nothing fresh. It was the kind of snow that was crunchy, and for some reason I always think about freezer burn when I encounter this kind of snow. My favorite part is this beef rib roast my step mom makes. It is so juicy and the texture is perfection. She also made my favorite potatoes in all the land, Heavenly Potatoes. I try and save myself so be able to fill up on the beef, predictable. I felt like a balloon when I came home. John and I went off to Boston for New Years. When we returned, all we are trying to eat will be light and yummy food. Which is why we have this Roasted Cauliflower and Parsnip Soup for you. Here is the deal with this soup, the cauliflower is great because it has a similar texture and mouth feel to potatoes but with less carbs! Hooray! The parsnips are so delicious when roasted because they just get a little sweeter. When we puree all these ingredients together to make this soup, it really feels as though you are eating a creamy rich soup. I think it is a perfect start to the new year when you still may crave all the rich foods you have been eating, but don\u2019t actually want to eat them. \u2665 Teri Roasted Cauliflower and Parsnip Soup Serves 4

VDirections:\u000a
p11171
aV1. Preheat oven to 375\u02daF.\u000a
p11172
aV2. Spread cauliflower, parsnips, shallots, garlic, and thyme onto a baking sheet, in a single layer, and drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with cumin, paprika, salt and pepper and toss everything together until the vegetables are well coated with oil.\u000a
p11173
aV3. Roast vegetables for 25-30 minutes, tossing vegetables around 15 minutes into the roasting process.\u000a
p11174
aV4. Meanwhile pour stock into a medium pot and bring to a simmer. Lightly season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p11175
aV5. Once vegetables have roasted through and stock is hot, transfer both the vegetables and 2 1/2 cups stock into the well of a blender. Securely fasten the lib, but remove the small, plastic center-top and replace that with a kitchen towel with your hand securely over the towel (this will allow for the stream to escape without a soup \u2018explosion\u2019 occurring).\u000a
p11176
aV6. Puree mixture for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture is smooth. Add more stock and continue to puree if necessary.\u000a
p11177
aV7. Transfer the mixture into the pot that the stock was in and bring to a light simmer. Stir in sour cream or crème fraiche and adjust seasonings.\u000a
p11178
aV8. Top each bowl with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and fresh thyme leaves and serve.\u000a

I don\u2019t recommend the latter. Really, these Sweet and Spicy Almond Clusters are perfect for those of you who love the sweet and spicy thing.

VAlthough we\u2019re already a couple weeks into spring, a lot of people are still experiencing frigid, icy weather. We love indulging in some of our favorite comfort foods, to help us keep warm when it\u2019s cold out. Today it\u2019s creamy skillet mac and cheese. We love macaroni and cheese, especially one that\u2019s super rich and cheesy, but there\u2019s something about an extra creamy, stovetop mac and cheese that\u2019s we just can\u2019t get enough of. We\u2019ve used a combination of President\u2019s creamy brie round and extra creamy camembert cheese to create our rich and creamy cheese sauce. We love how beautifully the cheeses melt together. We recommend cutting up few extra cubes of cheese as you prepare the dish, because you\u2019ll find it impossible not snack away as you cook. Seriously. Dijon mustard and ground ginger helps to cut the creaminess of the sauce and we love the light tangy flavor the mustard brings to the overall dish. The crushed cracker topping is one of our favorite parts of this dish and we urge anyone who makes this dish, not to skip out on this part. The buttery crackers and fragrant thyme add a much needed light crunch, balancing out the extra rich and creamy sauce. Plus you\u2019ll probably have extra crackers, which go perfectly with all that cheese you\u2019ll definitely be snacking on as you make this dish. Yay! Before we forget, we should mention that President\u2019s cheese is having a Pinterest sweepstakes where you all have a chance to enter and win $50 worth of your own President\u2019s cheese. Not too bad, right? You can visit their new website  ArtOfCheese.com  for details on how to enter and win! We hope some of you will try making this simple skillet mac & cheese, to help keep you cozy as the weathers slowly begins to warm up. Enjoy!

VI\u2019m currently in Boise for my sisters Bridal Shower and I\u2019m really excited because it means I get to eat at my favorite burger place in the world: Hawkins Pac Out. I personally think that it is better than Five Guys, or Fat Burger, or even In and Out. Honestly, I am not sure if the burgers (AND TOTS! Can\u2019t forget about the tots!) at Hawkins are actually better, it might just be one of those foods you grow up eating and as an adult still love while others might just think meh. Do you guys have any favorite foods you grew up eating that you still love that other people think are meh or gross? Today we have a Crumb Cake recipe for you. This is a Sour Cream and Cinnamon Crumb Cake. I grew up not liking crumb cake very much. I thought it was kind of a rip off. Where the heck is the frosting? Where are sprinkles? And WHY does this taste like coffee? Obviously my first experience ever eating a crumb cake was a coffee crumb cake. As a kid I thought cake meant birthday cake. As an adult, I know it doesn\u2019t. I have learned to like Crumb Cake now. I think a lot of it has to do with that fact there is no frosting, and that it\u2019s a one pan kinda deal that\u2019s really easy. The sour cream in this results in a really fluffy cake that isn\u2019t dry which is ideal for a cake with no frosting. With Easter just around the corner this might be a recipe to consider! \u2665 Teri Sour Cream and Cinnamon Crumb Cake Makes 1 (10\u201d) round cake

VIt\u2019s been just a little bit slow around here lately. We are working on some new big projects that we will be able to share with you in what seems like forever. I just wanted to remind you that we have totally not forgotten about you! I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time at home working and watching tv in the background. Most recently I\u2019ve been watching the Twilight series. Totally embarrassing I know, I really have a thing for saga series. Harry Potter and Star Wars are my usual go to, so I decided to watch Twilight to mix things up. It\u2019s so bad, it\u2019s good. Sometimes when the bad acting mixed with horrible writing happens all at once on the screen I totally get embarrassed and turn red, even though I am by myself. The reason I do like Twilight is because it is so bad it\u2019s good. Much like these Chocolate Chunk and Cinnamon Scones. They are so bad it\u2019s good in a different way. So bad, as in we made scones be yet another vehicle for the consumption of chocolate. Good, because you\u2019re eating chocolate. So let\u2019s be so bad it\u2019s good together and eat these Chocolate Chunk and Cinnamon Scones and watch Twilight. \u2665 Teri Chocolate Chunk and Cinnamon Scones Makes 9

VI never really knew what the hell a semifreddo was until I started reading  Donna Hay . Its pretty much one of the best things for summer. Essentially its ice cream without the pain in the ass part. No ice cream maker needed! Its one of those things where you should just let your schizophrenic taste buds go wild and come up with whatever flavor combinations you think might be awesome. Fresh fruit on the top always makes things more delicious and prettier. We used seasonal cherries for our Cherry Semifreddo with an Orange Cherry Compote. Great crazy with it! Go for it! \u2665 Teri Cherry Semifreddo with Orange Cherry Compote Makes 2 quarts

VHi Guys! Today we have another recipe from our collaboration with  Almond Breeze.  I\u2019m really loving experimenting around with almond milk in baked goods. It really is making them slightly lighter and I swear every time I substitute almond milk into my baked goods my boyfriend swears there\u2019s something different about them\u2026in a good way! Anyway, today we have these simple butter cupcakes, that are loaded with flavor and topped with a fresh grapefruit buttercream. We\u2019re cheating a little bit today by making a super basic buttercream. While I do love a delicious French or Swiss buttercream, I\u2019m not crazy about having to melt sugar each time I make it\u2026.so basic \u201ccheating\u201d buttercream it is\u2026and it\u2019s still smooth, creamy and delicious! Mother\u2019s Day is just around the corner and I\u2019m trying to think of clever ways to send my mom home some baked goods, since I won\u2019t actually get to be with her. I\u2019m seriously considering packaging up some of these cupcakes and buttercream with a cute little offset spatula and some fancy linen napkins and overnighting them to my mama\u2026.that way she can DIY frost and eat her own cupcakes! Although I won\u2019t be able to see my mom on Mother\u2019s day, I will be with my boyfriend\u2019s mom, celebrating her greatness as a mother and person\u2026and cooking for her, so these might just end up on that menu as well. We\u2019ll see! I hope everyone has a great Sunday! xx, Jenny Butter Cupcakes with Grapefruit Buttercream Makes 22

VOne of my favorite things about springtime, aside from gorgeous weather, is brunch. Al fresco weekend brunches are one of my favorite springtime activities. I love creating big spreads of delicious, family style dishes and this sausage, arugula and ricotta tart is a brunch-friendly dish I\u2019ve been really exited about lately. I love that it\u2019s really easy to throw together, especially since the filling ingredients are just mixed together and poured into the crust. I love the arugula in this tart because the sharp, bitter flavor cuts through some of the rich and cheesy custard. You can simplify this tart even more by using store-bought pie dough, although we recommend you make your own, for an extra rich and flaky crust. We teamed up with McCormick  once again  to create this recipe for their  Go4Gourmet program . We were tasked to create a recipe using ricotta cheese, panko breadcrumbs, McCormick\u2019s marjoram leaves, and a leafy green. We decided to create a savory tart with this combination of ingredients and although we think it\u2019s the perfect dish to serve at a bunch, it\u2019s also great to have for dinner, paired with a simple side salad. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Sausage Arugula Ricotta Tart Makes 2 Tarts *This post was sponsored by McCormick. Thank you for supporting our sponsors! It helps us keep going!*

VHi Guys! I\u2019ve been so into spring lately. I\u2019m loving all the gorgeous blooms popping up around my neighborhood, the great weather we\u2019ve been having and most of all, the crazy amount of gorgeous produce showing up at farmer\u2019s markets! The boyfriend and I have started a little intense patio garden and we\u2019re totally obsessed. We\u2019re first time gardeners and who knew it could be so much fun?! He\u2019s built a couple of wooden troughs and we\u2019re having a field day growing things like blueberries, kieffer limes, tarragon, purple basil, chocolate mint, baby mesclun, cherry tomatoes, and the list goes on! The most exciting thing about it?\u2026physically seeing the germination occur! It\u2019s so neat! It\u2019s like watching little babies grow\u2026little green babies. No black thumbs for us this year\u2026hopefully. Since we\u2019re totally feeling the spring/summer vibe we\u2019re spending the next couple of months loading everything we possibly can with fresh and delicious market produce and we\u2019re starting with this stacked side of salmon dish! Pretty, right?! I really wanted to make a dish that celebrates the beautiful bounty of the season and that was both visually stunning as well as delicious. This dish is perfect for light dinner parties and it\u2019s so easy to throw together. You can just pair it with a simple side salad, a fresh baguette, a great bottle of wine and dinner is served. There are just a few things to note with this recipe: The brown sugar and mustard rub work as sort of an adhesive for the veggies you put on top, so feel free to be liberal with brushing the mixture onto the salmon. I know veggies normally go beneath the protein in roasted dishes, to pick up the flavor of the meat juices, but today we\u2019re infusing our salmon with the juices from the roasted vegetables (that practically melt into the fish)\u2026so good! Also, sometimes I find that when the veggies are on the bottom they become a little on the mushy side and depending on the protein, they\u2019re also swimming in grease and fat. In this dish, the vegetables turn tender in the middle, but become slightly caramelized and crisp on top. The key is to make sure your vegetables are sliced very thin. It\u2019s especially important to slice things like carrots and potatoes super thin to make sure the vegetables cook evenly with the salmon. The last thing anyone wants is to bite into a crunchy piece of half cooked potato. No thank you. Another small tip is to make sure your vegetables and herbs are fully coated in olive oil before stacking them onto your salmon, otherwise they\u2019ll dry up and not roast evenly when you stick them in the oven. You can go nuts and pile on as much or as little veg. you want and whichever kind you want. I tried sticking with things I picked up from the farmers market, mostly to save myself from an extra trip to the grocery store, and I used a little thyme from my garden! (oh and just a little FYI\u2026if you grow herbs yourself, they will most likely bud and bloom\u2026so pretty!) If you\u2019re in a pinch and need a last minute meal that will impress guests, here you go. It\u2019s so simple and delicious. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Stacked Side of Salmon Serves 5 to 7

VIt has been unbearably hot in Los Angeles the last couple of days. I get really angry when I\u2019m too hot, and my face is in a permanent state of red, and I sweat too much. I hate it. Hate it bad. Ironically, we are posting a soup recipe today. Something I would totally not eat during this weather. So I would like to dedicate this Spicy Black Bean Soup to those of you who are wearing socks to keep your feet warm at night, covering your cold necks in huge scarfs, and wearing big jackets with your hands stuffed inside while you walk down the street. I envy you. I bet you all will eat this soup with those mittens on your hands that have the tops cut off so you can hold things better and use your iphone. That\u2019s cool, my sheets are in the freezer right now. I also want to mention that this soup vegetarian. AND vegan if you don\u2019t use the sour cream. \u2665 Teri Spicy Black Bean Soup Makes 5-6 cups - When blending hot liquids, its important to remove the center cap to the top and replace it with a kitchen towel to prevent a steam \u2018explosion\u2019 for occurring.

VWhen I was coming of age in Idaho, during the weekends my friends and I would hang out at coffee shops. It wasn\u2019t like how people hang out at coffee shops now, where they essentially go there and work. We would hang out there and basically do nothing, because there was nothing to do. I remember we all got chai lattes, because coffee was still pretty gross to us. In fact, I think chai was my bridge to coffee. As soon as I went to college and had to pull all nighters all the time, the chai latte morphed into a dirty chai and just kept getting dirtier and dirtier. I don\u2019t really drink chai lattes ever anymore, but I still love them. So when we decided to make this Banana Chai Cake I was really excited. I love banana bread, and banana dessert in general, so this Banana Chai Cake is like a really awesome food marriage that would have ideally existed back when my friends and I were coffee house loiterers. We like to serve this with whipped cream, or ice cream. Plain is good too though! \u2665 Teri Chai Banana Cake Makes 1 (9\u201d) loaf or 5 (3\u201d) loaves

VHi All! Hope everyone\u2019s having a great week! Teri and I just got back from a quick little trip and we\u2019re exhausted\u2026.but more on that to come :) I love to travel, whether I\u2019m going around the world or hoping in the car for a speedy road trip, I\u2019m pretty much down for it all. The only problem, I\u2019m constantly shoving decadent, rich, sweet, luscious things in my mouth (no self control, people\u2026absolutely none) the whole trip that I usually come home 5-8 lbs heavier. This would be totally fine with me if I didn\u2019t actually  feel  like I had gained the rapid weight which then automatically makes me feel sluggish and grumpy\u2026.toxic combo. So whenever I get home, I usually spend a few days \u201cdetoxing\u201d.  These Roasted & Stuffed Baby Eggplants are one of those snacks I consider to be a \u201ctrip detox\u201d snack. Quick, easy, delicious, fulfilling. Yum.  Even if you\u2019re not \u201cdetoxing\u201d from a trip this is a really great snack to have at anytime, or a great hors d\u2019oeuvre to serve at a cocktail/dinner party. Try it this weekend! Do it, Do it, Do it! Or don\u2019t\u2026.but I\u2019d be a happy camper if you did. :) Enjoy! xx Jenny Roasted & Stuffed Baby Eggplants Makes 12

VHi all! So I finally did IT the other day. I finally dusted off my running shoes and went for a run! I mean sure, maybe I got dressed for my run at 9am and anxiously dawdled around my apartment for a bit, postponing the much dreaded \u201cexercise\u201d for as long as I could. I was thinking of every excuse not to go through with this run. \u201cHm, my bathtub needs to be cleaned\u2026RIGHT NOW. Then I have to load the dirty dish towels in the washer\u2026RIGHT AFTER. Oh and then I should probably organize my closet RIGHT AWAY because I\u2019ve been meaning to for weeks now\u2026..\u201d 4 hours later the run happened. 33 minutes later I was back in my home\u2026.baby steps, people. As suspected, I felt crappy and tired before and during the run, but fantastic after! I plan on going for another run this weekend and hope it doesn\u2019t take me another half day to get myself motivated and moving around. We\u2019ll see. :) Anyway, today we have another rhubarb recipe\u2026in sauce form! We\u2019ve paired this rhubarb and sour cherry gastrique (a sweet and sour type sauce) with a tasty roasted rack of lamb and some simple fixins\u2019 (parsnip mash\u2026.my current obsession, and sauteed broccolini\u2026.so simple and tasty). This sauce is also really great with roasted duck, if any of you are into that\u2026.I totally am! We\u2019ve put together a full dinner for you all today; this Roasted Rack of Lamb & Rhubarb Sour Cherry Gastrique is great for a dinner party, a nice family dinner or even a lovely little date night! Enjoy! xx Jenny Roasted Rack of Lamb & Rhubard Cherry Gastrique Serves 2 to 3

VDirections:\u000a
p12226
aV1. For the lamb: Preheat oven to 375°F. Place oil into a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Season rack on both sides with salt and pepper. Sear lamb (fat side down, first) for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and allow to rest, about 5 minutes. While the lamb rests place the panko, tarragon and melted butter into a small bowl and mix together. Brush the mustard over the lamb and top with a layer of the panko mixture, gently pressing to ensure the crust sticks to the lamb. Place lamb back into sauté pan, crust side up and roast for about 15 minutes [for medium-rare] and about 20 minutes [for medium]. Allow rack to rest for 5 to 7 minutes before slicing and serving.\u000a
p12227
aV2. For the Gastrique: Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan and sauté shallot over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Add rhubarb and continue to sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Stir in orange juice, vinegar, port, and sugar and simmer until the mixture has reduced by 1/3. Add the remaining ingredients and stir. Simmer until the mixture is just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Discard the star anise and bay leaf. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of butter and spoon over roasted lamb.\u000a
p12228
aVDirections:\u000a
p12229
aV1. For the Parsnip Mash: Place parsnip and potato chinks into a medium pot and fill with water. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Boil parsnips and potato for about 25 minutes or until fork tender then drain. When the mixture is still hot add the butter and begin mashing the mixture with a potato masher. As the mixture begins to breakdown, begin adding the cream or milk until fully incorporated. Generously season with salt and pepper. Fold in green onion, if using. Serve warm.\u000a
p12230
aV2. For the broccolini: Pour oil into a large sauté pan and place over medium-high heat. Add broccolini and sauté for about 4 minutes. Add garlic and continue to sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.\u000a

VHi Guys! We\u2019re on day #3 of our grilled cheese week and today we have a rich and spicy Buttered Kimchi Gruyere and Green Onion Grilled Cheese. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a snob about very many foods, but when it comes to kimchi, I\u2019m hyper-critical (but aren\u2019t most Koreans?). It\u2019s something you either love or hate, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really an in-between with this spicy, fermented cabbage filled with stinky goodness. I personally prefer using \u201cold\u201d of aged kimchi for my grilled cheeses. This might seem like a strange combination, but I promise you guys kimchi and cheese go really well together\u2026AND if you like kimchi but have never sauteed it in some butter, you\u2019re in for a pretty tasty surprise. The kimchi becomes caramelized, slightly sweetened and the texture softens. This grilled cheese may not be everyones cup of tea, but if it is or you\u2019re in for a mini culinary adventure, it perfectly hits the spot! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Buttered Kimchi Gruyere and Green Onion Grilled Cheese

VHi Guys! I\u2019m getting so excited for the summer because there\u2019s always something going on and something to do. I also love summer grilling, barbecues and eating one of my favorite things in the whole world\u2026sweet corn! We were lucky enough to receive some gorgeous sunshine sweet corn from a collective of family farmers in Florida. What\u2019s particularly exciting about this corn is that the sweetness peaks throughout April and May, which means getting our corn-fix on two whole months before summer begins! The lovely people over at Sunshine Sweet Corn are also running a fun  Pinterest contest  where you can win great prizes. Make sure to head on over to their site for  full details. We used our corn to create this super light and refreshing Sweet Corn Gazpacho. I love raw corn. I always find myself nibbling on freshly cut kernels, every time I cook with corn. I love the crunch of each individual kernel and how they explode the bright sweet flavors into your mouth. So fresh, so good. I don\u2019t think people use raw corn enough, I certainly don\u2019t but need to start\u2026which takes me back to this gazpacho. It\u2019s a different take on the standard tomato gazpacho. I love fun flavored gazpachos, like our  Stra wberry and Tomato Gazpacho.  Our sweet corn gazpacho is a tad bit more hearty, but still makes for a super fresh and light dish. You can kick up the heat by adding in a serrano or jalapeno pepper to the mix. This soup is so easy to make and you can add in whichever fresh ingredients you want, depending on your taste. Sometimes I\u2019ll blend 1/2 a bunch of cilantro directly into the mixture for a more intense flavor.Yum. This recipe is great because it\u2019s vegan and gluten-free (so long as the stock/broth you use is homemade or gluten-free, as some store bought stocks/broths contain gluten). As the weather starts to warm up, I hope you guys try out this quick, easy and delicious sweet corn gazpacho. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Sweet Corn Gazpacho Makes 6 to 7 cups *This post was sponsored by the  Sunshine Sw

VHi All! Today we have a simple jam recipe for you\u2026that\u2019s also really tasty! We\u2019re making use of all the awesome rhubarb that\u2019s been popping up this last month or two! Jam is something I really love to make during summertime. Berries are inexpensive, it\u2019s super easy and makes great gifts for really any time of the year. Rhubarb is something that makes a really great addition to jams and I love utilizing it in more than just as pie filling! The cardamom and cinnamon also add great flavor to the jam. I would recommend using the spices rather sparingly as they can easily over power the rhubarb and raspberry flavors. If you\u2019re big rhubarb fans like us, you\u2019ll love this jam! We also have another awesome and totally different rhubarb inspired recipe for you all on Friday\u2026so watch out\u2026and of course, enjoy! xx Jenny Rhubarb Raspberry and Cardamom Jam Makes 4 cups

aV1. Place rhubarb, raspberries and apple juice into a medium pot and stir together. Place over medium heat and cook down for about 20 minutes, occasionally stirring.\u000a
p12431
aV2. Add remaining ingredients and stir. Simmer for 45 to 55 minutes or until jam is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. (jam will thicken more as it cools). **You can also remove 1/2 tablespoon jam from the pot and allow to cool. If jam is thick enough when cooled, remove from heat, if not, stir in 2 tablespoons apple juice and boil for about 5 more minutes.\u000a
p12432
aV3. Allow jam to cool completely before serving.\u000a
p12433
aV4. For canning: Sterilize jars in a pot of hot water and lids/rings in a separate pot of hot water.\u000a
p12434
aV5. Fill each jar until 1/2 inch remains at top and tightly seal with lids.\u000a
p12435
aV6. Place filled and sealed jars in a hot water bath about 3 inches tall and gently boil for 5 to 10 minutes. Allow jars to come to room temperature before refrigerating. Jam should last about 2-3 months.\u000a

VThis Austin trip Jenny and I took was amazing. I slept really well, and it was a super fun break from the normal everyday. The normal everyday being wakened up twice in the middle of the night around the same time from my ginger senior cat yowling at walls for no reason. A quick google will reveal that he is totally going insane because he is old. It is really strange. He sits and stares at things, and then falls asleep, staring at things. He gets hyper like once a week and runs around on a crazed rampage with a wide eyes look on his face, then goes right back to sleep. It is sad, but funny and weird at the same time. I think this part in his life will become my favorite because as a grumpy old man, he has no problem letting his freak flag fly. If Tigger (my senior cat) were a human, I would make him this Rhubarb Raspberry Crumble. We would eat it together, and I would ask him what he finds to interesting staring at walls, why he likes to cuddle so much, and why he doesn\u2019t like it when I touch his cankles. This is one of those delicious easy desserts (or lets be real, breakfast / whenever) dishes that are best when it is still warm. So plan accordingly, and don\u2019t forget ice cream! \u2665 Teri Rhubarb-Raspberry Crumble Serves 7-9

VIf you\u2019re really over these Grilled Cheese posts, good news, this is the last one! It\u2019s a personal favorite: Cantaloupe and Brie Grilled Cheese. I love brie, and brie with cantaloupe is really awesome. If you want to get really crazy, I would add some prosciutto. So with all these Grilled Cheese situations we have been posting I kind of want to throw a grilled cheese party. This would be such an awesome party for so many reasons. First, you have your guests cook the food and not you, that\u2019s pretty cool. Second, you can just buy everything and you don\u2019t have to slave in the kitchen for hours and hours. Third, everyone gets to eat what they want. I imagine it being some kind of awesome set up with all kinds of pre shredded pre sliced cheese, and lots and lots of toppings. Why isn\u2019t this is a thing? Oh wait, it is a thing. I just looked it up on Pinterest. Man, sometimes Pinterest can be such a downer. Quick! Direct me to the best inspirational quote board you know! \u263a(All jokes aside, I love Pinterest). \u2665 Teri Cantaloupe and Brie Grilled Cheese

VTo start our second day of our little Grilled Cheese week we have this Roasted Poblano and Corn Oaxaca Grilled Cheese. I personally have never put corn in my grilled cheese before this recipe and it\u2019s a pretty good idea. I have never used a ciabatta roll for my grilled cheese either. Now that I am thinking of it, I have totally not been putting the effort into my grilled cheeses that they probably deserve. I usually use cheddar cheese and this super nut packed seedy wheat bread. That\u2019s it, I am now embarrassed to say. We mentioned this in yesterdays post that we are not listing amounts of our ingredients this week because grilled cheeses are so flexible that you can do almost anything to them and they are good. I think that is what makes grilled cheese such an awesome thing. You can get really creative with whatever you put in between the two slices of bread. We all know I have a lot of work to do that in area. I\u2019m excited to share with you our other favorite grilled cheese preparations coming the rest of the week! \u2665 Teri Roasted Poblano, Corn and Oaxaca Grilled Cheese

VHi Guys! We had a blast in Austin, ate a ton and are so happy to be back! I learned A LOT and came back totally inspired with so many fun recipe ideas. I can\u2019t wait to share them with you in the next month or so\u2026.lets just say there are both awesome hot and cold SMOKED thing in the near future (totally easy too!)! Today we have rhubarb pickles for ya. I love pickled things of all kinds, I love the basic cucumber pickles, I love gherkins, pickled onions, pickled garlic, pickled carrots, pickled pigs feet, pickled eggs\u2026.I LOVE pickled things. One thing I love to pickle is rhubarb. That\u2019s right, no need to save up precious stalks of rhubarb during the summer for just pies and crumbles\u2026there are so many awesome savory things to do with rhubarb and pickling is one of them! I like to think this is similar to those giardiniera pickled peppers and other vegetables, only rhubarb. I like eating my rhubarb pickles atop hot dogs or I also like dicing it up with olives and spreading it onto a giant Italian beef sandwich for a little kick and tang. One of my favorite things to do with these pickles is to serve them with a little bit of cheese and charcuterie. The sharpness of these pickles goes great with the rich meats and cheese. I\u2019ve made these pickles rather sharp and sour, but feel free to adjust the spice, sugar and salt amounts based on your own preferences! I just prefer a more sour pickle, but if you\u2019re more into a bread and butter type sitch feel free to add an extra tablespoon of sugar. You can also omit any of the different spices I\u2019ve added, because there is certainly a lot going on in there. If you\u2019re more of a dill pickle type of person, then feel free to omit some or all of the spices and drop a handful of fresh dill into the mix. Pickles can be such a personal thing, I urge you all to try out these rhubarb pickles and adjust them to fit your taste. Have a great weekend! xx, Jenny Rhubarb Pickles Serves 8 to 10

VDay 4 of Grilled Cheese. Are you sick of them yet? I googled why eggplants are called eggplants and it\u2019s because some of them look like goose eggs. In case you were wondering also. Today we have a vegetarian option for you, this Eggplant and Sun Dried Tomato Grilled Cheese. I always wonder how vegetarians out there feel about eggplant. It seems like when you go to a lot of restaurants their vegetarian entrees always consist of some kind eggplant situation. I always thought it was kind of a cop out in a way. I\u2019m not entirely sure why I feel this way when I think about it, I think it is because I always notice it as being the token vegetarian option. Once upon a time I was a vegetarian (hard to believe I know), and I always hated going out to eat and having to choose between something eggplant, and a salad. I loathed eggplant, but as my diet changed and I started eating pretty much anything, I now love it. Do you guys like eggplant? Yesterday I had an interesting conversation with the people I work with about Grilled Cheese. It seems that two of them were Grilled Cheese purists. They don\u2019t think you can call a Grilled Cheese a Grilled Cheese if you shove a bunch of other ingredients in there. What do you think? I think if it\u2019s going to make it taste better, you should probably do it. \u2665 Teri Eggplant and Sundried Tomato Grilled Cheese

p12706
aV1. For grilled eggplant: Sprinkle each slice of egg plant with salt, flip over and repeat. Allow slices to sit for 20 minutes. Rinse salt off each slice and gently pat dry. Heat a grill or grill pan to high heat and brush with oil. Grill eggplant rounds on each side for 4 to 5 minutes. Lightly season with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to use.\u000a
p12707
aV2. Slather both sides of each slice of bread with butter.\u000a
p12708
aV3. Sprinkle some shredded cheese onto a piece of olive bread and top with grilled eggplant rounds. Top eggplant with another generous sprinkle of cheese and a small amount of rosemary.\u000a
p12709
aV4. Top the cheese with a layer of sliced sundried tomatoes followed by a final sprinkle of cheese.\u000a
p12710
aV5. Drizzle pesto over the layered ingredients, top with another slice of bread and gently press grilled cheese together.\u000a
p12711
aV6. Place a cast iron skillet over medium heat and melt a couple tablespoons of butter. Once the butter has melted and the skillet is hot, carefully place the grilled cheese into the skillet and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until the bottom is nicely toasted and some of the cheese has melted. Flip the grilled cheese and continue to cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the bottom is toasted and the remaining cheese has melted.\u000a
p12712
aV7. Transfer grilled cheese onto a cutting board. Allow the sandwich to sit for 3 to 5 minutes before cutting the half and serving.\u000a

VWhen Teri and I are alone in the studio together there are a few things that have become lunch \u201cstaples\u201d. We\u2019re all about the working lunches so it\u2019s usually something that can be whipped up quickly, like one of our favorite things: DIY sushi bowls. Our other main alternative is turning to Urth Caffe. We love the large variety they offer and the eats are usually pretty healthy, yet filling. Although a big positive is that they offer a large selection of salads, sandwiches, paninis, quiches, pizzas, etc. I seem to ALWAYS get the same thing\u2026.the D\u2019Lox pizza. I just really love this \u2018za and love that it usually takes me two sittings to finish it. The combination of the crispy crust with velvety pieces of smoked salmon, rich creme fraiche and then all the bright and fresh toppings create the most amazing flavor blast in your mouth. So good! Today we\u2019ve created our own version of that amazing, yet simple pizza. You can alter this however you want! Sometimes I add a layer of thinly sliced cucumbers to the mix or crushed pepper flakes for a slight kick. I think as long as you\u2019re using fresh ingredients, you\u2019re all good. This is great to serve cut up for a brunch, cocktail party or just a quiet night in with a nice glass of white wine. The super bowl is coming up in the next week or so (I looked it up on the internets and everything!) and not everything necessarily needs to be heavy and fried. This is probably going to end up on my super bowl table this year as a delicious, healthier alternative to all the super rich dishes that are bound to cascade the tabletop. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Our Best Ever Smoked Salmon Pizza Makes 2 pizzas

p12781
aV1. Preheat oven to 425°F. (be sure to preheat pizza stone as well, if using)\u000a
p12782
aV2. For dough: Place water, yeast, sugar, honey, and olive oil in a mixing bowl and gently stir together. Allow mixture to sit for 5 minutes (water should begin foaming slightly).\u000a
p12783
aV3. While yeast mixture sits, sift together flour and salt. Add flour mixture to yeast mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until fully incorporated and dough begins to form. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 8 to 10 minutes. (dough should spring back when poked)\u000a
p12784
aV4. Form into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and place in a warm area and allow to proof until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 -2 hours. Punch dough down and turn onto a clean, lightly floured surface.\u000a
p12785
aV5. Divide dough into two equal pieces and roll each piece into a 14 inch disc, about 1/4 inch thick. Cover baking sheets with parchment and sprinkle with a layer of cornmeal. (if using a pizza peel, sprinkle peel with thin layer of cornmeal)\u000a
p12786
aV6. Place crusts in prepared baking sheets, pierce the surface all over with a fork, and brush with small amount olive oil.\u000a
p12787
aV7. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Remove from oven and allow crust to cool before topping.\u000a
p12788
aV8. To assemble: Dollop 1/2 the crème fraiche atop the crust and top with pieces of salmon. Top salmon with a sprinkle of red onions and capers. Sprinkle 1/2 arugula and dill (sprigs, lightly torn) over the top and finish with a little salt, pepper and lemon zest. Serve.\u000a

VIt occurred to me that we don\u2019t have a pumpkin pie recipe on the blog. Pumpkin pie is my favorite pie on earth. It is so good that I even think pumpkin pie from Vons is good. I like pumpkin pie that much. I have done variations upon variations with pumpkin pie, and I still like a pretty normal filling. What I do like to experiment with is the crust. Ginger snap, vanilla wafers, or in this case chocolate! With the experimentation of crust I now have a new favorite pan, which is a tart shell pan. I love this way because when you finish baking and cooling and finally take it our of the pan you can see the beautiful crust. It is just so impressive! So today we are sharing with you a delicious and creamy Pumpkin Pie with a Chocolate Crust. I love the addition of chocolate. It just makes this pie that much more exciting. I hope you guys enjoy my most favorite pie ever! \u2665 Teri Pumpkin Pie with a Chocolate Crust Makes 1 (9 inch) pie

VHi Guys! Today we have baked chocolate donuts for you! Oh the donut. I feel like I could write (really bad) poems and songs about my love for donuts. I have always self-proclaimed myself as a non-sweets person; after dinner I usually want meat/cheese/crackers and usually scrunch my nose up at cakes/cookies/pies. Not that I don\u2019t enjoy tasting  sweets and desserts, because I do love  tasting  them, but usually just enough to get a sense of the flavors and textures and not to eat the whole thing or even close to it. This all changes though with donuts. I don\u2019t know what it is about soft, rich, fried dough that I love so much but I can genuinely say (from straight up experience) that taking a dozen donuts to the face, in one sitting, would be no problem for me. Ever. I definitely have my favorites, and these days I LOVE a good old fashioned doughnut that\u2019s been fried in peanut oil (peanut oil is KEY when talking fried doughnuts) and encased in the thinnest layer of sweet vanilla glaze. I think it\u2019s exciting that donuts have gotten so fancy in the last several years with awesome shops like  Doughnut Plant VooDoo Doughnuts Sidecar Doughnuts  and so many others! I love a good, fancy doughnut with fun flavors, but am just as happy with a donut from any hole in the wall spot around town\u2026.just has to be tasty! (nor am I a stickler for the spelling\u2026as you can see I\u2019m annoyingly interchanging them even within this post\u2026sorry not sorry!) Although old fashioned ones are probably my favorite type of donut as an adult, as a kid it started when I was 5 years old and had my very first donut: a chocolate on chocolate cake donut with chocolate sprinkles. A classmate had brought them into class for her birthday and my bratty 5 year old self pretty much dove for the triple chocolate donut, claiming it for myself.\u2026and the donut obsession began. Today we have a recreate of my favorite childhood donut, but a baked version. While I still prefer fried over baked, these are super delicious and so easy to make\u2026plus you cut down on a lot of the mess by baking and not frying. I also think donuts can seem intimidating to make yourself if you\u2019ve never done it before and removing the frying factor also removes some of that stress and intimidation! I use bread flour in this recipe because it results in a slightly denser (and chewy\u2026if that makes sense) donut, so you feel like you\u2019re eating a real cake donut and not just  regular chocolate cake that was shaped into an \u201cO\u201d.  Also, if you find that your glaze is a little gritty and not totally smooth, just throw it into a blender or food processor for a minute before transferring it to your double boiler to ensure a nice, smooth texture! If anyone is looking for a super delicious baked donut, loaded with chocolate\u2026you may have just found it! (I say as I sit shamelessly giving myself a pat on the back) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Our Best Ever Baked Chocolate Doughnuts Makes 20

VDirections:\u000a
p12956
aV1. Preheat oven to 350\u02daF.\u000a
p12957
aV2. Place flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Set aside.\u000a
p12958
aV3. Pour buttermilk coffee, eggs, butter, vinegar, and vanilla into another mixing bowl and whisk together.\u000a
p12959
aV4. Pour the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture and stir until fully mixed. Fold in melted chocolate until just combined.\u000a
p12960
aV5. Lightly grease a couple baked doughnut pans and pour batter into a piping bag or gallon sized re-closeable bag and pipe batter into the doughnut molds, filling 3/4 of the way up.\u000a
p12961
aV6. Bake the doughnuts for 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of a doughnut.\u000a
p12962
aV7. Remove from molds and transfer doughnuts onto a cooling rack and allow doughnuts to cool completely.\u000a
p12963
aV8. For glaze: Place all ingredients, except powdered sugar, into a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir until butter and chocolate have melted and mixture is smooth. Whisk in powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, until all 2 1/4 cups has been added and mixture is smooth. Pour mixture into a heatproof bowl and set over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of simmering water (to create a double boiler, which is needed to keep the glaze loose and make it easy to dip the doughnuts)\u000a
p12964
aV9. To assemble: Dip the tops of each doughnut into the warm glaze and shake to remove any excess glaze. Place doughnuts onto a cooling rack, glaze side-up and top with a small amount of chocolate sprinkles. Repeat until all doughnuts have been dipped and sprinkled. Allow doughnuts to sit for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the glaze to harden. Serve.\u000a

VToday we have baked chocolate donuts for you!
p12967
aV) Although old fashioned ones are probably my favorite type of donut as an adult, as a kid it started when I was 5 years old and had my very first donut: a chocolate on chocolate cake donut with chocolate sprinkles.
p12968
aVA classmate had brought them into class for her birthday and my bratty 5 year old self pretty much dove for the triple chocolate donut, claiming it for myself.\u2026and the donut obsession began.
p12969
aVI use bread flour in this recipe because it results in a slightly denser (and chewy\u2026if that makes sense) donut, so you feel like you\u2019re eating a real cake donut and not just  regular chocolate cake that was shaped into an \u201cO\u201d.

VCurry Fried Chickpeas. This is something that I didn\u2019t even realize existed till I had them recently. It was totally a surprise. Like when I learned young Disney stars were not that innocent. Only this was a good unexpected surprise. They are basically delicious little fried morsels (I hate that word, couldn\u2019t think of a better one). The good thing is, they are beans, which is kinda healthy right? I also heard somewhere ( I think it was Perez Hilton\u2019s fit site (BIG JK)) that curry prevents joint swelling. So there you go.

aV1. Preheat oil to 375°F.\u000a

aV2. Place the garbanzo beans onto a sheet pan lined with paper towels and cover with paper towels to dry.\u000a
p13115

aV4. Place the remaining ingredients into a mixing bowl and toss together until fully combined.\u000a
p13117
aV5. Once the oil is hot drop about a third of the garbanzo beans into the oil and stir around to ensure they don\u2019t stick to one another.\u000a
p13118
aV6. Fry the beans for 5 to 8 minutes or until light and crisp.\u000a
p13119
aV7. Drain onto paper towels for a minute before tossing them in the curry mixture.\u000a
p13120
aV8. Shake off the access curry mixture and set the coated beans onto a clean sheet pan. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p13121
aV9. Repeat with the remaining beans (in two more batches) and season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.\u000a
p13122
aV** If you don\u2019t feel like fried foods a good alternative is to roast them:(omit the cornstarch) Preheat your oven to 375°F.  Pour the dried chick peas into a large mixing bowl and toss together with 2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil and the spice mixture. Spread the mixture onto a sheet pan, in a single layer and roast for 20-30 minutes, stirring around every 10 minutes, or until desired texture is achieved (you\u2019re looking for a crisp outside with a creamy inside).\u000a

VThis is seriously the best cookie recipe ever. Jenny is awesome sauce. I brought these to a new years eve party. Some girl thought it was really weird that there was salt on them. She said something like \u201cI like these cookies, but why is there salt on them.\u201d I have no comment, other than that\u2019s like asking why there is jelly on this pb & j.

VWhen I was growing up, my Mom owned a coffee cart at our college and Airport (which back then I think was technically a terminal because it was so small). I would often go with her to work as she stocked the shelves and what not. I hated going. We always went into the airport through the kitchen where they prepared all the food for the airplanes. It smelled horrible in there. Like cleaning solution and disgusting food. So naturally as a brat, I complained SO MUCH when I had to go. So my Mom would always give me a cookie from her coffee cart. At first I just ate shortbread, lots and lots of shortbread cookies, so much so I can\u2019t even eat them now. Later, she started carrying a local bakeries cookies. The chocolate chip cookie from there was unreal. Sweet, but not too sweet, moist, fluffy, everything you dreamed an amazing chocolate chip cookie would be. Since moving away I think about these cookies so often. So today we have our best ever Chocolate Chip Cookies. The main thing that is important is the fact these cookies are fluffy (mixed with a slight chewy texture). Why is that important? Because Chocolate Chip Cookies are made to be eaten with milk. The fluffy factor happening with these cookies lets the milk really sink in. Which means these Chocolate Chip Cookies are the ultimate cookies MADE for dipping in milk. I hope you love them as much as me!! \u2665 Teri Our Best Ever Chocolate Chip Cookie Makes 18

VI know Halloween just ended, but we\u2019re jumping right into a sweet treat even I can be on board with\u2026sort of :) (I wonder if sweets will ever excite me as much as things like braised short-ribs or flammin\u2019 hot cheetos\u2026sigh) This year for thanksgiving forget the pumpkin pie and pecan pie\u2026how boring! Okay not boring, totally delicious\u2026.BUT why not give your guests something a little unexpected?!  These Cinnamon Spiced Mini Cupcakes are great for a few reasons: 1) They\u2019re mini\u2026everything mini is better, me thinks. You can eat more and not feel as guilty. 2) They still have the \u201cspice\u201d flavors you would expect and hope for in a autumn sweet treat. 3) They\u2019re topped with candied ginger. Candied ginger is awesome. So sure, maybe a lot of you can\u2019t bear to part from your family\u2019s 200 yr old pumpkin pie recipe and the tradition of baking it every Thanksgiving for dessert\u2026but what about offering your guests a welcome cupcake upon arrival? Just a thought. Enjoy! xx Jenny Cinnamon Spice Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting and Candied Ginger Makes 24

VHappy Halloween! Since I\u2019m not too into sweets, but know that Halloween is one of the biggest candy holidays of the year I thought I\u2019d compromise and present you guys with this awesomeness. Yes. Chocolate.Dipped.Potato.Chips. Okay, so maybe we\u2019re cheating a little because this isn\u2019t really a full \u201crecipe\u201d per-say\u2026.but the fact that it\u2019s Chocolate.Dipped.Potato.Chips. makes everything okay, right? You\u2019ll forgive us, won\u2019t you?! I think the only way this could possibly get any better would be to sprinkle a generous amount of  crumbled bacon over the chocolate before it hardens\u2026but that\u2019s just me. A good thing to note:the thicker the chips the better (i.e. ridge chips, kettle chips). Using thin potato chips sort of makes them a little soggy after awhile and I also feel like you kind of lose the saltiness and crunch from the chips, which is one of my favorite parts. Anyways, I hope everyone has a great and safe Halloween, whether it be sitting at home watching horror movies, pretending to not be home because you forgot to get Halloween candy, or dressing up as Whorey Potter and partying it up\u2026..hey, no judgement here! xx Jenny Chocolate Covered Potato Chips Makes 1 (15 ounce) bag

VThanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays, as I\u2019m sure it is to many others. There\u2019s just something so comforting about being surrounded by loved ones, reflecting over the year and truly thinking about what you\u2019re thankful and grateful for and last but certainly not least the food. Ultimate comfort food. While the traditional dishes are absolutely wonderful, I totally get that not everyone wants to go through the task of roasting a whole turkey, or even a whole turkey breast. So this year why not think a little outside the box and make these turkey meatballs instead?! What\u2019s so awesome about turkey meatballs? Not too much I guess\u2026but paired with this cranberry barbecue sauce and BOOM. You get something totally different and awesome! You still get the sweet and tangy flavors of cranberry sauce with the depth and flavor of a smoky barbecue sauce. Okay, so maybe it\u2019s a little extreme ask people to replace the roasted turkey on thanksgiving or to think that meatballs are a sufficient equivalent to a beautifully roasted turkey, BUT wouldn\u2019t this make a great holiday party hors\u2019dourves? Just a thought. Enjoy! xx Jenny Herbed Turkey Meatballs with a Cranberry Barbecue Sauce Makes 16-20

aV5. For the sauce: Place first six ingredients into a saucepan and stir. Bring the mixture to a simmer, over medium to medium-low heat.\u000a

VHoliday season is upon us, and it is becoming stressful. Thoughts running through my head include: How the heck am I going to pull of Thanksgiving for the first time? Will it be fun or disgusting to shove my hand into the big hole in the back of a turkey? How do people keep everything warm with one oven? I wonder who the next celebrity that gets weird nude photos stolen off their phone will be? I hope I don\u2019t burn things. So there is that going through my head. Constant circle of thoughts that is never ending. I know some of you are probably Thanksgiving veterans, so if you have any words of advice, I will very much appreciate it. Moving on to things pertaining to this post, these are cute little appetizers. They are little filo pockets filled with goodness and they are super pretty. The tops kind of remind me of my hair when I wear it up. This is a bad thing, and now I will reconsider my go to hairstyle. Anyway, these are actually a great appetizer for parties. They are gorgeous, and easy. Not to mention the ingredients lend itself to Thanksgiving. We also have a lot of other appetizer recipes in our recipe index if you are looking for something specific.

VHi. Do you ever go to a super pretentious party and they serve weird appetizers that look like cat food on a cracker? I\u2019ve been there. I usually eat it, even if it smells like cat food too. Why not? I\u2019ll eat just about anything, and because I have cats, the cat food smell is nothing new to me. In fact, I like the smell of cat food now. Anyway. Super pretentious food sucks. No one  really  likes it, and if you do like it, you are simultaneously admitting that you too, are pretentious. Enter Scotch Eggs. Its like the median between pretentious and trashy, kinda. You have a quail egg (pretentious? sorta), and then breakfast sausage (not even close to pretentious), IN ONE. Plus its fried, so that should give it like +5 un-pretentious points. its delicious, and pretty. How can you not like breakfast compacted into a small little meat ball? I dunno. \u2665 Teri Scotch Eggs Makes: 12

VIts kinda cold here in LA (47 degrees, don\u2019t laugh). In fact, this is the first time ever in this apartment that I have lived in for three years, that I turned the heat on. It was scary. The fire alarm went off a lot. I was expecting a lot of bad smells because the gas heater would have to burn through cat hair and dust that made it through the vent, but that didn\u2019t happen. It was great. Now my apartment is super warm. So this whole cold thing makes it feel a bit more holiday like. I\u2019ve watched Elf 5 times already this month. Such a good movie. I have my mini pink Christmas tree up with the ornaments secured to the tree (my cats are brats), and a couple of strings of lights up. I am looking forward to going to some Holiday parties, and seeing my family in cold ass Idaho. Mostly though, I am looking forward to going to parties where you have to bring food. Then you show up, and food destroy everyone. What does food destroy mean you ask? It means your food tastes better and looks better than what everyone else brought. You know it, and they all know it. The girl that brought the gross orange looking dip will stare you down because her casserole dish of nastiness is still in tact while your stuff is gone. This may seem childish and stupid, but whatever. Its my thing, and yes, I secretly judge you as a person for whatever food you bring to a party. So I encourage you all to go to parties with the intent to food destroy everyone. These Cracked Out Rice Krispies Treats are a pretty good start. The creative and funny name will give you extra points. \u2665 Teri Cracked Out Rice Krispies Treats Makes 24

VHi All! We\u2019re really excited over here at SFB because today we\u2019re doing our first cookbook review. This is something we have thought a lot about. We draw a lot of inspiration from cookbooks and thought we would share some of the books that stuck out to us. We thought that :  Libbie Summer\u2019s The Whole Hog Cookbook  was super fitting for our first review because we are bacon fanatics. For those of you who don\u2019t know Libbie Summer\u2019s she\u2019s the very talented food stylist for Food Network\u2019s Paula Dean. When we received our copies of the book we were totally stoked by the title. It\u2019s a great cookbook that really does live up to its title; it picks the pig apart from head to toe and even goes into offal meats, curing your own bacon and making your own leaf lard (great for pastry/pie doughs). It\u2019s a great resource for somebody looking for delicious and informative pork recipes. The graphic design is also refreshing and simple, and super cute. Don\u2019t forget to take a peek under the dust jacket! What we found really interesting was how she was able to incorporate pork products into dessert recipes and still keep them tasty and simple. One of our favorite recipes is the  Bacon Banana Cookies . These cookies are so good; they\u2019re like bites of banana bread in cookie form with small burst of salty bacon. It\u2019s a great sweet and salty combo. The cookies are topped with cinnamon-sugar before being baked and the added sweetness and crunch of the sugar and spice from the cinnamon add great flavor and texture to these soft, pillow-like cookies. We\u2019ve included the recipe for these awesome cookies below\u2026like seriously, they\u2019re so good! Overall we think this cookbook is filled with awesome and interesting pork recipes like Pork Belly Gyros, Citrus-Sugar Rubbed Ribs and Scottish Quail Eggs (similar to our Scotch Egg recipe over here on the blog!)  It\u2019s also a great cookbook to just flip through because of the beautiful photography and great layout design; we totally recommend this as a great holiday gift for the bacon and pork lovers in your life.

VHoliday time is officially here! Okay, so in theory the holidays are great, but really they\u2019re stressful and expensive. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still love holiday time, but it is what it is. Something I like doing to alleviate some holiday stress is give homemade food items as gifts..particularly sweets and baked goods. This is one of those things I\u2019m definitely going to make. I\u2019m going to package them up in really cute Martha Stewart holiday craft gift boxes and give them away as small tasty gifts. I had chocolate covered Ritz crackers for the first time last year. Oh man, after I ate my first one I was on a mission to hoard boxes of this \u201climited edition\u201d stuff for the next month\u2026. I thought they were  that  good. This year I thought I\u2019d make my own. I thought the only way they could get better was adding peanut butter. Turns out, I was right. They\u2019re so good\u2026really I promise. Please make these for loved ones this year, they\u2019ll love you even more for it! Plus, they\u2019re super simple to make.

VIf french fries and onion rings ever got married and had a baby, I think it would be something like this\u2026a potato ring. You have a light and crispy outer coating with a soft potato and caramelized onion center\u2026why? Because we can I guess, who knows\u2026but it\u2019s kind of fun, right?! My boyfriend and his friends have this thing where every super bowl they have a \u201cDeep-Fry Fest\u201d where, well they deep fry everything; so if you\u2019re anything like my boyfriend you now have another \u201cDeep Fry Fest\u201d recipe to use! Two things I can\u2019t stress enough is: 1) the importance of having the potatoes completely coated;  no holes  please, or the mashed potatoes will pour out of the holes once they hit the oil. 2) the importance of the rings being frozen  solid  before entering the oil\u2026it just helps with the frying, that\u2019s all. Finally, since ranch is pretty much good with anything it only seemed natural to pair these savory, fried treats with a quick and easy homemade ranch sauce.

VDirections:\u000a
p14063
aV1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with water.\u000a
p14064
aV2. Bring to a boil on medium-high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, a20-25 minutes.\u000a
p14065
aV3. Drain the potatoes into a colander and pour back into the pot.\u000a
p14066
aV4. Pour the cream and butter over the potatoes and mash with a potato masher until smooth (Add more cream 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed).\u000a
p14067
aV5. Fold in the caramelized onions and chives until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and stir.\u000a
p14068
aV6. Spread the mixture onto a sheet pan, about ½ inch thick and place in the refrigerator until the mixture has cooled down and hardened, 4-6 hours.\u000a
p14069
aV7. While the potato mixture cools place both flours, garlic powder, onion powder and smoked paprika into a shallow dish and stir together until fully combined. Set aside.\u000a
p14070
aV8. When the potato mixture has cooled, remove from the refrigerator and using 1-1 ½ inch circle cutters, cut out as many circles as possible (usually makes about 32-40).\u000a
p14071
aV9. Using a ½ inch circle cutter, cut out a ½ inch circle from every 1-1½ circle, creating a small donut shape.\u000a
p14072
aV10. Dip the potato rings into the flour mixture followed by the egg mixture and finally again in the flour mixture (make sure the rings are completely coated).\u000a
p14073
aV11. Place the coated rings onto a clean sheet pan, lined with parchment paper and place in the freezer and allow the rings to freeze completely, 4-6 hours.\u000a
p14074
aV12. Once the potato rings are frozen, preheat the oil, in a large pot, to 375°F.\u000a
p14075
aV13. While the oil heats up, place the ingredients for the dipping sauce into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p14076
aV14. When the oil is hot, carefully drop a few of the rings into the oil and fry for 4-6 minutes or until golden brown.\u000a
p14077
aV15. Drain onto a large plate lined with paper towels and season with salt with pepper.\u000a
p14078
aV16. Repeat with the remaining potato rings and serve immediately with the dipping sauce.\u000a

VIf french fries and onion rings ever got married and had a baby, I think it would be something like this\u2026a potato ring.
p14081
aVYou have a light and crispy outer coating with a soft potato and caramelized onion center\u2026why?
p14082
aVBecause we can I guess, who knows\u2026but it\u2019s kind of fun, right?!
p14083
aVMy boyfriend and his friends have this thing where every super bowl they have a \u201cDeep-Fry Fest\u201d where, well they deep fry everything; so if you\u2019re anything like my boyfriend you now have another \u201cDeep Fry Fest\u201d recipe to use!
p14084
aVTwo things I can\u2019t stress enough is: 1) the importance of having the potatoes completely coated;  no holes  please, or the mashed potatoes will pour out of the holes once they hit the oil.

VSo there\u2019s this place called E&O Trading Co. in San Fran and they have these AMAZING corn cakes, well technically they\u2019re called \u201cIndonesian Corn Fritters\u201d and I\u2019ll say it again\u2026they\u2019re AMAZING! Okay, now here\u2019s the thing\u2026.I\u2019ve never actually had the fritters nor have I ever been to the restaurant. Then why am I being a freak and raving about something I\u2019ve never had?? Well, I\u2019m a very visual person and I saw them being pimped out on a food show one time and became kind of obsessed. I have problems, I know. They also went into the kitchen where they filmed the chef make a giant batch, so naturally I drove to the store right away to pick up some ingredients to make these. I changed around some of the ingredients and added some red corn, because I found some at the market and thought it would be pretty. I wasn\u2019t disappointed\u2026these things are SO good\u2026especially if you make a little honey and Sambal sauce (spicy chili sauce) dipping sauce. I love that they\u2019re pretty much all corn kernels with no batter. It\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s simple. Try it. The End :) xx Jenny Crispy Corn Cakes Makes 12

VHi All! So we know we\u2019ve been a bit MIA this week, we\u2019re just taking a little holiday break-skies\u2026.BUT before the New Year hits we wanted to leave you with a fun little cake recipe that sparkles\u2026our NYE Rose Water Glitter Cake! We flavored ours with rose water because the floral aroma is actually quite pleasant and the flavor isn\u2019t overwhelming. The rose water cake also goes great with the sweet basic buttercream frosting we\u2019ve paired it with (if you thought our last buttercream frosting recipe was a bit scary with melting sugar and all, you\u2019re sure to like this one. Super easy!). If rose water isn\u2019t your thing it\u2019s no problem at all, just swap it out for another flavoring of your choice. Also, are the glitter raspberries not super awesome?!?! You should steal this idea and put it on other things. They look so cool! We hope you enjoy our glittery concoction and continue to have a very Happy Holidays!

VDirections:\u000a
p14216
aV1. Preheat oven to 350°F.\u000a
p14217
aV2. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.\u000a
p14218
aV3. In a stand mixer or with a hand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar for about 3 minutes.\u000a
p14219
aV4. With the motor running add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.\u000a
p14220
aV5. Add the dry mixture and milk to the butter mixture, alternating in thirds, until all of the dry ingredients and milk have been incorporated. Stir in 1 tablespoon of rose water.\u000a
p14221
aV6. Divide the batter between two greased and parchment lined 9 inch cake pans and bake for about 25 minutes or until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of each round.\u000a
p14222
aV7. While the cakes bake, make the frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, whip the butter. With the motor running, add the powdered sugar, ½ cup at a time until all of the sugar has been incorporated. Add the milk and vanilla into the mixture and beat until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.\u000a
p14223
aV8. Allow the cakes to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and place in the refrigerator for about an hour.\u000a
p14224
aV9. Once the cakes have chilled, slice each in half so there are a total of four cake layers.\u000a
p14225
aV10. In a small bowl stir the remaining rose water into the simple syrup.\u000a
p14226
aV11. To assemble: Place a single cake round onto a cake turner (or clean surface) and brush the top with some of the rose water syrup. Add a thin layer of frosting over the syrup and top with another layer of cake.\u000a
p14227
aV12. Repeat step 11 until all of the layers have been used. Coat the cake in a thin layer of frosting to create a crumb coat and allow the cake to chill for 30 minutes.\u000a
p14228
aV13. Decorate cake with the remaining frosting and begin to dust cake with gold luster dust. (I find the easiest way to completely coat the cake in luster dust is to dab some onto a pastry brush, pull the bristles back with my fingers and flick it towards the cake)\u000a
p14229
aV14. Roll raspberries in luster dust until well coated and arrange on top of the cake. Serve.\u000a

VHi Guys. A couple of months ago, we were asked by the nice people over at  Nescafe  to go to this event called a \u201cfoodie meet up\u201d at  Joe\u2019s  restaurant in Venice beach. Joe himself made us table side tuna tartare which was amazing, something you might see our take on in the future\u2026and by we might, we mean you will :) Anyways, after our fabulous dinner we were invited to stay and watch a demo on this nifty little machine called NesCafe\u2019s Dolce Gusto. It\u2019s a single cup coffee maker that initially seems to be jumping on the \u201ck-cup\u201d band wagon, that is until you realize it makes legit specialty drinks as well as regular coffee\u2026including SKINNY LATTES. Hello?! It\u2019s awesome. We were each lucky enough to score one of these machines for attending the event and since everything we do translates back to food, we thought we\u2019d give all you rad folks a fun coffee recipe. Enter little vanilla sponge cakes\u2026dowsed in coffee\u2026.covered in coffee buttercream (REAL French buttercream thankyouverymuch)\u2026. rolled in toasted, sliced almonds. Yep, that\u2019s right. These cakes are sort of a weird little version of the classic dobos torte\u2026minus the fun caramel wheel on top. So go out and make these cakes because they\u2019re cute and tasty. Maybe enjoy some cake with your new  Dolce Gusto  machine?

VDirections:\u000a
p14302
aV1. Preheat oven to 325°F.\u000a
p14303
aV2. Using a stand mixer, fixed with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, scraping down after each addition. Carefully stir the flour into the mixture and mix until just combined. Set aside.\u000a
p14304
aV3. Place the egg whites in a clean stand mixing bowl and beat with a whisk attachment. As the egg whites become frothy begin adding the powdered sugar until all has been used. Add the vanilla and continue to bat until stiff peaks form. Fold the white mixture into the yolk mixture until just combined.\u000a
p14305
aV4. Spread a thin layer of the mixture onto two baking sheets lined with parchment and lightly greased. Place the baking sheets into the oven and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool.\u000a
p14306
aV5. While the sponge cakes bake, make the frosting: Place the sugar, water and corn syrup into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Place the egg yolks in a stand mixer, fixed with a paddle attachment and whip until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Once the melted sugar mixture has reached 240°F remove from the heat.\u000a
p14307
aV6. With the motor of the stand mixer running, slowly pour the sugar mixture into the whipped yolks, in a steady and thin stream.(making sure the eggs don\u2019t scramble)\u000a
p14308
aV7. Once all the sugar has been incorporated, begin adding the cubes of cold butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Continue whipping the butter until all has been used and the mixture is light, fluffy and smooth. Fold in the coffee. extract until just combined. Set aside until ready to use.\u000a
p14309
aV8. Once the cakes have cooled, use a 3.5 inch circle cutter and cut 10 circles from each sheet pan. Gently remove the circles from each sheet pan.\u000a
p14310
aV9. Place a small dot of frosting onto the center surface of a cake stand and place a cake circle over it. Using a pastry brush, dab the surface with a small amount of coffee to moisten and flavor the cake.\u000a
p14311
aV10. Spread an even layer of frosting over the coffee doused cake circle and top with another cake circle. Repeat with the coffee and frosting until a five layer cake has been made. Add a thin crumb coat of frosting around the sides and top of the cake and set onto a sheet pan lined with parchment. Repeat with the remaining cake circles until a total of 4 mini cakes have been made.\u000a
p14312
aV11. Place cakes in fridge and allow the cakes to chill, about 2 hours. Place another even layer of frosting around each cake and coat the sides with the toasted almonds. Serve.\u000a

VA couple of months ago, we were asked by the nice people over at  Nescafe  to go to this event called a \u201cfoodie meet up\u201d at  Joe\u2019s  restaurant in Venice beach.
p14315
aVJoe himself made us table side tuna tartare which was amazing, something you might see our take on in the future\u2026and by we might, we mean you will :) Anyways, after our fabulous dinner we were invited to stay and watch a demo on this nifty little machine called NesCafe\u2019s Dolce Gusto.
p14316
aVIt\u2019s a single cup coffee maker that initially seems to be jumping on the \u201ck-cup\u201d band wagon, that is until you realize it makes legit specialty drinks as well as regular coffee\u2026including SKINNY LATTES.
p14317
aVWe were each lucky enough to score one of these machines for attending the event and since everything we do translates back to food, we thought we\u2019d give all you rad folks a fun coffee recipe.

VHi all! So today we have another great edible holiday gift to give out this holiday season. It\u2019s a mix of cheddar and caramel popcorn. This is inspired from this great place called Garrett\u2019s Popcorn in Chicago. They have multiple locations, but it originated in Chicago\u2026as did The Chicago Mix\u2026 The combination might sound weird, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really not. It\u2019s totally awesome. It totally plays on the sweet and salty flavors, with the addition of nutty and cheesy\u2026SO GOOD! I love going home for the holidays and NOT attempting to stop at a location to pick some up. I stick to ordering mine online every year\u2026why? Because lines for Garrett Popcorn Shops are usually at least a block long. No joke. Holidays are the worst too. When I don\u2019t feel like spending $25 on shipping for popcorn I usually go out and buy my own cheddar popcorn, make my own caramel corn and mix \u2018em up. Caramel corn is a lot easier to make than most might think. So try this recipe out because it\u2019s easy, fun, tasty, and you can package it in cute jars and give them out as gifts. Enjoy! xx Jenny Cheddar and Caramel Popcorn Mix Makes 9 quarts

VHi Everyone! I hope you all had a fun and safe New Years! Do you all indulge in New Years resolutions? Not me. Why? Because I\u2019m realistic. I know even if I tell myself that I\u2019m giving up diet coke or will force myself to yoga 5 times a week\u2026I know it\u2019s not going to happen, so why put myself through all the fuss? I\u2019ll do my usual dress up for yoga and end up sitting on the couch to catch up on housewives and continue to order menu items I know I shouldn\u2019t because my willpower  just doesn\u2019t exist. For those of you who have made New Years resolutions and plan on keeping them, I applaud you. For those of you like me, here\u2019s an awesome dessert recipe that\u2019s also super simple to put together. When the end of summer hits I tend to go on a berry binge and freeze and preserve as many berries possible. This is a great time to take advantage of some of those frozen berries. These mini galettes are great to have in the morning with your coffee or at night, slightly warmed with a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Happy New Years! Now lets start it right by forgetting the diets and baking these awesome sweets, okay? xx Jenny Mini Blueberry Galettes Makes 14 to 16

VAfter taking the leap and getting my own studio this year, I am slowly organizing it so it can be both kinda pretty and functional. I am still working on the dish organization part, and moving stuff around, getting stuff built. Its actually kind of a pain, but I still love it. I think in a couple of months we might do a little behind the scenes post so you can see where we work most of the time, the excessive plate buying problem I have, and maybe you can meet some of the cute cats that run around the hallways of the lofts where my studio is at. I think that would be fun. I wish I could also see all the workplaces where you all spend your time. I am always so curious, where you all read our blog from, and what it looks like around you. If you want to post some pictures of your neat workspace on our facebook, you should, because I think that would be fun. Then it will be like we are trading pictures. Thats kinda cute. In other news, Spoon Fork Bacon has its own  twitter . You should use that if you don\u2019t want to read tweets from me about how I eat entire sleeves of saltines for dinner. In other other news, this recipe is pretty awesome. Making your own chips for your own hummus is really fun too. Think of all the way you can cut that bread to make fun shapes to dip into your hummus with. Crazy. \u2665 Teri Spiced Sweet Potato Hummus and Cumin Flatbread Chips Makes 2 cups

VIt\u2019s Friday\u2026yay!  So I know I said that we would be jumping into our Super Bowl fry fest next week, but we got a little excited and couldn\u2019t resist starting a little early\u2026.enter baby chimichangas. These little beauties are pretty great; small pockets of fried goodness with a creamy Sriracha-lime dipping sauce. Why are these chimichangas so special? Two reasons: 1) You can actually taste the filling! It\u2019s not just a piece of fried flour tortilla which I\u2019ve often feel I\u2019ve been served when ordering chimichangas. 2) They\u2019re little and cute; and the rule is that the smaller the food is, the more you can eat. Well, that\u2019s my rule as least :) These little guys are filled with large chunks of chicken, diced poblanos, fresh corn, sharp cheddar\u2026yea, they\u2019re awesome me thinks. You can make this quick and easy recipe even faster by buying a roasted chicken and shredding it up. Just a thought :) So as everyone gets their menus together for \u201cBinge Eating Day\u201d (lets be serious, most of us care about the food way more then the \u201cbig game\u201d) I urge you all to stick these on your menu this year. You won\u2019t regret it\u2026..I promise! xx Jenny Baby Chimichangas Makes 16

VHi All! So I know I say it all the time, but\u2026..I don\u2019t have a sweet tooth. I really wish I had one, but I just don\u2019t. I love making sweets, but could totally care less about eating them. Maybe it\u2019s because my mom was never a \u201cbaker\u201d so to say while my sister and I grew up. Maybe it\u2019s because sometimes my parents and I tend to order a few appetizers to share after a big meal instead of a dessert or two to split (true story). Or maybe it\u2019s just the way I was hardwired, I don\u2019t know. In my mind a piece of cake will never look as appetizing as a cheeseburger, I\u2019ll always walk away from a cream puff, to indulge in a pate and cheese plate and saying no to ice cream is no big, while short-ribs? Impossible. There\u2019s one exception to this\u2026.Nutella. What is it about this stuff that get people (including me) so excited? I think it\u2019s the chocolate-hazelnut flavors and the smooth, rich texture. I also think it\u2019s because it reminds me of \u201cYan-Yans\u201d. PLEASE tell me somebody know what I\u2019m talking about? Those toasty, sort of sweet, bready sticks that are served along side a small amount of chocolate or strawberry\u2026not even sauce but frosting! These things are awesome\u2026but I digress. Back to Nutella\u2026it\u2019s great; today we have an awesome and super simple salted Nutella tart recipe for you all. I added a touch of sea salt and topped it with a light whipped cream to offset the super decadent Nutella. Oh and lets not forget the super buttery and nutty crust! I used almonds because it\u2019s what I had on hand, but you could replace I with hazelnuts if you prefer. Enjoy! xx Jenny Salted Nutella Tarts Makes 12

VHi. Hi. I wanted to thank everyone who left a comment and told me awesome places to go in Seattle. It was fun, and not too cold. I sometimes had a fourth meal. One day I walked around town with the top button of my pants undone. Intentionally, for extra room purposes. It was overall really great. I have never eaten so many oysters in my life. So thanks everyone for leaving me helpful comments! You made my trip better! In other news, we are still on with fried week. Recipes for Superbowl. Will you guys be watching? I wonder what kind of awesome commercials they will play. This  one  is my all time favorite. I hope you all enjoy people running into each other and catching balls, and good food, and good people.

More on that in due time. We are getting kinda grumpy, and kinda wanting to have drinks at noon and lay on bubble wrap on the floor of the studio instead of working. Its almost over, and I am super excited when this month is long gone. It makes you think though, about how lucky we both are that we are doing a job we love, even though we think that sometimes it sucks. Anyway, I\u2019m going to Seattle this week, and I want to ask you guys, if you know of anywhere awesome to buy some cool plates and linens. I\u2019m not talking about Crate and Barrel stuff, I\u2019m talking about local ceramicists and neat stores. I will also super appreciate food recommendations. Thank you in advance. :) Now, back to the food. I don\u2019t really have much to say about this dish because you probably already know its delicious. But what I will say is that I eat this when I feel fat. It has like a built in magic trick to make you feel full, but not \u2018fat\u2019 full. If that makes any sense. So if any of you are feeling like fatties out there, you should try this Tuna Tartare with Belgian Endive Leaves. :) \u2665 Teri Tuna Tartare with Belgium Endive Leaves Serves 3 to 5

VAt times like this when things are so busy and crazy I need to take a step back and think about how lucky and grateful I am for such an awesome business partner and friend..I believe you all know her\u2026her name is Teri Lyn Fisher (or TEWI!!), my blog buddy plus much much more. She\u2019s weird, quirky, fun, stressful (ha!), willing to make compromises\u2026sometimes :) , and just an overall really good person. When we work together (which is practically EVERYDAY this month!) it\u2019s fun\u2026really fun. We have such a good time being silly, talking about the most random things (like disturbing movies, boys, pets, deep frying raw eggs\u2026), eating everything we style/photograph, yet getting everything we need to get done and doing it well\u2026we think at least ;) It\u2019s nice to take a minute every now and then to step back and appreciate some of those amazing people around you. Anyways, back to food. We have these little pie sticks today. They\u2019re fun, simple and who doesn\u2019t like pb&j? Especially in such a cutie-patootie form, right?! So make these and give them to someone you\u2019ve been appreciating lately. They\u2019ll thank you for it\u2026.and yes any pie filling will do, so fill them with whatever you want if pb&j isn\u2019t your thing.

VDid you all have a good super bowl or puppy bowl? Madonna is scary, no? I\u2019ve been seeing pictures of her from the Super Bowl, and it literally scares me. Nightmare scary. Anyway, asparagus fries are actually pretty neat. They are surprisingly crispy. Asparagus is one of my favorite green things to eat, and this is a new way I have never had them before. Pretty good. These would also make a good side dish. The trio of sauces you can serve with them are pretty bomb. My favorite thing about these are the little asparagus spear tops.

Add tomato paste, oregano, thyme, and rosemary and continue to sauté for 3 minutes. Deglaze pan with the wine and vinegar and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes.

VHi. I hope you all had a nice Valentines day. I did. I went to eat at a place in Hollywood, you know the places with prix fixe menu. So you basically get decisions forced upon you. It was nice though. At dessert the dude at the table next to us began to eat part of the \u201cdessert for two,\u201d and in a perfect moment, where our conversation had a pause, and the music stopped, we overhead him loudly exclaim that it tasted like diapers. We burst into laughter. He tried to save his comment by then explaining he used to change his nephews diapers. It didn\u2019t work. In case you were wondering, yes, somehow the panna cotta we got served totally tasted like diapers. I\u2019m not sure what they were going for, but it wasn\u2019t good. So now that we are done with fried foods, and valentines foods, we thought we would start with this light Edamame dip that is paired with Japanese Crackers. It makes a really great snack. You could also just prepare the Edamame Dip and use it as a simple spread on toast, or anything really. Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Edamame Dip with Homemade Japanese Rice Crakers (Senbei) Serves 4 to 6

p15138
aV1. For edamame dip: Place soy beans, red onion, miso, garlic, cilantro, sesame oil, and chili sauce into a food processor and pulse 10 times. With the motor running, add olive oil in a steady stream until fully incorporated and the dip is smooth. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p15139
aV2. For senbei crackers: Preheat oven to 350°F. Place rice flour, cooked rice, oil, and salt (and nori, if using) in a food processor and pulse 5 times. With the motor running, add the water until a dough forms.\u000a
p15140
aV3. Turn onto a clean surface and knead for 2 minutes. With wet hands, roll tablespoon sized balls and place between two sheets of plastic wrap or inside a Ziploc bag. Using the back of a glass press ball until flat (super flat).\u000a
p15141
aV4. Place discs onto a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 4 to 5 minutes. Flip crackers and bake for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. In a small bowl whisk together soy sauce and honey. Brush sauce onto the tops of crackers and place back into oven and top with sesame seeds. Place crackers back into oven. Turn oven off and allow crackers to dry, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and serve with edamame dip.\u000a

VI\u2019m kind of a pickle hater. I really only like them when its relish. So these were interesting for me. Let me tell you though, these are good. Even for non pickle fans. They are SUPER crispy, and easy to make, and delicious. The bleu cheese in my opinion is the best part. You should make them for Superbowl. Duh. This is why this week we are just posting artery clogging food. Then next week, we can all go to us magazine and search for the latest celebrity liquid cleanse (just kidding). Ok, so yay football, yay fried foods. Go Lakers! (bad joke, I know) \u2665 Teri Panko Fried Pickle Chips Serves 6 to 8

VHi All! We\u2019re ending \u201cDeep-Fry Fest\u201d week over at SFB and leaving you all with this gem of a recipe\u2026.Korean.Fried.Chicken. It\u2019s a fun take on the classic buffalo wings that everyone seems to love oh so much (rightfully so)\u2026especially for the super bowl. If you love wings you\u2019ll love this simple and AWESOME take on fried chicken. You would think that battering the wings before frying would leave you with oily and heavy fried chicken, but it\u2019s totally not true\u2026it\u2019s the opposite. The batter actually helps make the chicken super light and extra crispy\u2026crunchy is probably a better word\u2026but not like gross crunchy\u2026just super crisp. You know crunchy sound effects they use on tv? I bet they use Korean fried chicken to make that crunchy food sound effect\u2026Are you all getting that this is super crisp chicken? Have I beaten that into your heads enough? Just a little? :) I beg you all to set aside the weird dip recipes (you know which ones I mean, don\u2019t play dumb), store bought chips (oh c\u2019mon), delivered pizzas (lazy bums!)\u2026pretty much all that crap plus more that you see infesting the Super Bowl year after year; and instead serve your guest (or be the awesome guest that brings) this TOTALLY fantastic, SUPER simple, EXTRA crispy fried chicken. The classic sauce for these wings is a spicy Korean bbq sauce made with Korean chile paste. This sauce is really great, but also super spicy (sweat-worth spicy) so I\u2019ve added a mild alternative of a honey-soy sauce which is totally different, but just as good. If you\u2019re a purest and don\u2019t want to stray from the classic buffalo wings, no problem\u2026I\u2019ve given a sauce recipe for that too! Just use this fry method\u2026please\u2026you\u2019ll never, ever make fried chicken any other way. I promise you. I hope everyone has a great weekend, wearing their \u201cfat-pants\u201d and being happy! xx Jenny Korean Fried Chicken Serves 4 to 6

VHi All! Did everyone have a great weekend? I did! I was styling a cookbook all weekend, but it was great nonetheless\u2026why? Because the clients were AWESOME\u2026some of the nicest, hard working people I\u2019ve ever met. In fact, the whole team was really wonderful! It made shooting 8 straight days in a row fly by and we really had a good time shooting. The lovely women of  Piccolo Chef  are the people I\u2019m referring to. The company is an Italian inspired children\u2019s cooking school, based out of LA and run by two wonderful women, Tina and Lillian. Tina and Lillian  are two women who have worked together for years in the \u201cserious business world\u201d before they decided that they were going to leave their corporate jobs and open up a healthy children\u2019s cooking school, inspired by their own children and the desire to teach them about healthy eating/cooking from an early age. They have literally spent the last few years building their business from the ground up and have truly created a wonderful thing. On top of the ladies being genuinely good people they remind me a lot of myself and Teri and the way we work together. They\u2019re both sassy, opinionated, bicker with one another like teenage sisters, and above all they are extremely driven and passionate about what they do. It was quite the week, I learned a lot and had fun, which is the most important part of working, me thinks\u2026learning and having fun :) Oh and did I mention they host  cooking birthday party\u2019s  for kids?! Yep, totally genius. Anyway, just wanted to share something that I\u2019ve been working on lately that now means a lot to me :)\u2026now back to food! We have these cookies on the blog today\u2026and I\u2019m not going to lie, I haven\u2019t been this excited about one of my recipes in quite some time. Pork belly sliders, love\u2026.chicken lettuce wraps, wrote when I was 18 and held onto it ever since!\u2026.but there\u2019s just SOMETHING about these cookies that makes me want to do my happy dance. It\u2019s probably because I was \u201cthat\u201d kid in grade school who peeled her pj&j apart, stuff it with potato chips and then smooshed it all together again. SO GOOD. This cookie is pretty much a throwback to \u201cthat\u201d Jenny; the 7 year old me who decided that the sweet and salty combo was a keeper, for life. They\u2019re peanut butter thumbprint cookies, rolled in crushed potato chips, baked, and filled with the jelly or jam of your choice! Enjoy! xx, Jenny *Just a little tip: Don\u2019t actually use your thumb to make the thumbprints\u2026keep the balls of dough in balls and use your pinky\u2026or something else small to make the hole\u2026why?\u2026they sssppprrrreeeaaadddd like crazy!

VHello everyone. Happy Friday! I hope you all have super fun plans for the weekend. I am going to New York and will hopefully be seeing my friends  Amanda  and  Nicole . If you guys have any suggestions on where to eat or shop for props (plates, linens, kitchen stuff), I would love to hear it and I would very much appreciate it!! So, I think we all know that when something has the word pork in it, its probably going to be bomb. Like these Pork Belly Sliders. The carrot, daikon, and cucumber make it feel less heavy and glutinous. The neat thing about these is that you can make a bunch and have them for dinner, or you could totally just make one big one and eat it yourself. P.S. The marinade for this is awesome. Awesome sauce. Literally. \u2665 Teri Pork Belly Sliders Makes 16

VPotatoes and bread. These things I could eat forever and ever. Stranded on a deserted island? I want bread and potatoes (ok\u2026 and cheese, and coffee, and gummy bears). Why are bad things so good? WHY? Its evil. There are tomatoes in the marinara, so those are good for you. Anyway, this recipe is all Sandra Lee semi home made in your face. Sometimes I want pizza, and potatoes, and a marinara dipping sauce, and I don\u2019t want to get all up in my kitchens business to have it. Don\u2019t judge.

VI have this problem, where whenever I hear the words peanut butter, I think of this song I used to sing as a kid. It makes me so mad, because usually I end up singing this song in my head for awhile. I can never get it out!!!! While searching the internet for this lovely song, I cam across this super annoying video. This is probably the most obnoxious video I have seen in a long time so I recommend watching like 5 seconds of it, or just not at all.  HERE  you go. Ok, but the REAL video, the video of the song I think about is  HERE.  I picked this one because it is sufficiently awkward, and the way the man carrying the camera says jelly is funny. Truth, its still an annoying video and I won\u2019t hate you if you don\u2019t watch it. So, Creamy Peanut Butter Pies, that is what we have today. Super easy, and really freaking good, especially if you like peanut butter. The peanut butter is crazy creamy, and light and fluffy. I hope you all have a great weekend, and eat lots of good food. \u2665 Teri Creamy Peanut Butter Pies Makes 1 9 inch pie OR 24 mini pies

VHi Guys! Today we have some little Italian cookies for you, called Baci Di Dama, literally translating to \u201cLady Kisses\u201d. People all them this because they tend to look like dainty little pairs of lips, cute right? They also kind of resemble two people kissing, the way they\u2019re all sandwiched together\u2026again, precious. These cookies might originate from the Piemonte region of Italy, but you can really find them all over the country. I had these little cookies specifically when I was in Florence, although they were filled with a hazelnut flavored chocolate and made using almond meal/flour. Since sweet chestnuts are so common in Florence, and my only memory of these cookies are from that city, I decided to make these little cookies with a 50/50 blend of all purpose flour and chestnut flour. The chestnut flour works great in this recipe and totally imparts a lovely and slightly unique [chest]nuttiness to the cookies. Can\u2019t find chestnut flour or don\u2019t want to order it online? Not a problem, 100% all purpose works just fine, although you\u2019ll lose the chestnut flavor and the texture of the cookies will be slightly more \u201cbiscuit\u201d like. These are great with coffee and tea, but my favorite is serving them as apart of a mix dessert platter with tall glasses of champagne. Yum! These little cookies are tasty, super cute and really easy to make\u2026so do it! ) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Baci Di Dama Cookies (\u201cLady Kisses\u201d) Serves 6 to 8

VHi! We have these neat little Moroccan cookies for you today, Chebakia. These cookies are similar to a number of Korean desserts because they\u2019re not incredibly sweet and have a strong sesame taste to them. Many korean sweets are sesame and honey based or studded in sesame seeds and this Moroccan cookie is super similar to a few different Korean sweets such as Yakgwa and Hangwa. We\u2019ve changed this traditional little dessert up by dipping the cookies in a mix of honey and homemade ginger syrup, rather than the typical honey and orange blossom water combo. We\u2019ve also replaced the almonds for hazelnuts which does change the flavor quite a bit (pine nuts work great too!). These fried cookies are pretty easy to make (don\u2019t be intimidated by the shaping technique) and great to enjoy with a cup of coffee or a mild tea. Surprise your guests with Chebakia: Moroccan Sesame Spice Cookies for a unique little after dinner treat or add these to your next weekend brunch menu!

p15800
aV7. Place dough into a mixing bowl and cover with a clean, damp towel. Set aside and allow to rest, about 20 minutes.\u000a
p15801
aV8. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch thick.\u000a
p15802

p15803
aV10. Take one of the prepared squares and weave the slits through your pointer finger. Take the corners closest to the tip of your finger and pinch them together. Slow pull your finger out of the slits while pulling the pinched end through the center, coming out the other end. Gently open up each side and gently press together. Set aside and repeat until all squares have been shaped.\u000a
p15804
aV11. Fry each cookie in the oil, a few at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels and repeat until all cookies have been fried. Set aside and allow to cool.\u000a

VHi All! Guess what? I\u2019m a procrastinator\u2026big time. For example, today\u2019s post\u2026.I was supposed to write this last night, but didn\u2019t. Now, I\u2019m feverishly writing away trying to finish before Teri gets in this morning for our shoot today! Also, if you were to look at my iphone, you\u2019d notice the screen is completely cracked\u2026usable, but cracked. This happened about 2 months ago\u2026.but I\u2019ve been procrastinating getting it fixed. Well that\u2019s also partly due to my laziness, but that a whole other subject. Anyway, who cares if I\u2019ll be cursing at myself later for watching 2 HOURS of reality  garbage  television instead of getting my laundry done (ugh) or getting the haircut I\u2019ve been putting off for 6 months!! (gross, I know). Will I ever grow out of this?! Probably not, but I\u2019m okay with it and I can openly admit: I Procrastinate and I\u2019m [not so] proud of it! Now to food, today we have something that I never put off making if I say I\u2019m going to do it: Root vegetable fritters! They\u2019re so tasty, easy to make and the parsnip adds a hint of unexpected sweetness (in totally a good way) to the fritters! They\u2019re also a great inexpensive and super easy appetizer or side dish to any meal! Make \u2018em, please?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Root Vegetable Fritters Makes 16 to 20

VShrimp toast has become one of my favorite things. I first discovered shrimp toast at an amazing restaurant here in LA called  Son of A Gun . I\u2019ve been hooked ever since. So we made shrimp toast for you in little nuggets that you can pretty much eat in one bite. It makes it much easier to eat like 10 at a time. That is what I did when we made these so you will get no judgment from me. These Shrimp Toast Nuggets are going to be one of my favorite go to appetizer recipes from now on! \u2665 Teri Shrimp Toast Nuggets  Serves 8 to 10

VHi All! Last year I went to the Bahamas to celebrate my sister\u2019s bachelorette weekend. There were about 9 of us ladies and we had a really great time. One of my favorite things about the about the trip was the fact that everywhere I turned there were Conch Fritters (one of my best memories on the trip involved food, go figure). When I first saw them I was skeptical, thinking that I would be biting into a mouthful of greasy, bready batter. Nope, not at all! They were light, crisp and filled with chopped conch (think humungous clam of sorts, in more of a \u201csnaily\u201d type shell). I think I had a fritter with every meal while I was there, super good! Anyway, I made my own little version of these conch fritters, using shrimp because it\u2019s a lot more common and well, I love shrimp :) These fritters really are light and crisp on the outside and rich and savory on the inside. We\u2019ve paired them with our  spicy honey drizzle , which we\u2019ve used before for our hush puppies\u2026the super simple, sweet and spicy sauce goes really well with these bites. You should make them for your next cocktail party, game night or even just as a nice little snack anytime. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Shrimp Fritters Makes about 30

VI have been having a Wonder Years marathon. Its pretty awesome. Did you know netflix now has all the seasons on instant? Did you know that Winnie Cooper grew up to be some brilliant math person who  tweets  palindromes? Did you know that Travis from Clueless (Breckin Myer) pretty much plays the same exact character on the early episodes of The Wonder Years also? Its weird. I love that show. Anyway, on the blog we have been posting a lot of Thanksgiving and  party food  recipes to gear up for December. Parties are fun. Its a bit stressful to figure out what to bring sometimes. I just happen to have some thoughts on what to bring to holiday parties. If you\u2019re single, and going to a party you hope to meet a cute boy, maybe bring  Bacon Jam . Most boys like bacon. I think. If you\u2019re single and going to a party to meet a girl, maybe bring  Chocolate Covered Potato Chips.  All girls love potato chips. If she won\u2019t eat them because she is watching her figure, you don\u2019t want to date her anyway. Trust. If you\u2019re going to an office holiday party, maybe bring our  Potato Rings.  They are good, and they are fried, which means everyone that has good taste in food will like them. If you\u2019re going to a holiday party anywhere in California, bring these! They are perfect and light and yummy! \u2665 Teri Cheesy Quinoa Cakes with a Roasted Garlic and Lemon Aioli Makes 10 to 12

VI went home this past weekend to Boise for my cousins wedding. Going back home for me is always a struggle. The internet is reeeaaallllyyy slow there. You can\u2019t eat any kind of food you want whenever you want. Everything is closed on Sundays, and when it gets really hot there, I sweat in places I don\u2019t want to talk about. Once I hop on the plane back to LA, I then start to realize all the awesome things about Boise. Friends, family, rivers, camping, stars, and thrift stores. Things that I want to do more of in and around LA, but I am just not sure how. Do any of you LA people have some awesome summer activities you want to share? :) Today we have this amazing delicious recipe. I feel like everything is the form of nuggets is good. These are no exception. Chicken frying them makes them really crispy, but the inside still stays juicy and yummy. We also gave you two sauces to dip with. Honey Mustard, and Grilled Banana Ketchup from a post last week. If you missed it, go see it and try it. It\u2019s soooooo good. \u2665 Teri Chicken-Fried Sweetbread Nuggets Serves 4 to 6

VHey Guys! When I was growing up cereals like shredded wheat wasn\u2019t something we ate\u2026.ever. Nor did we do, super healthy, super low in sugar, organic granola, or even steamy hot oatmeal with a sprinkle of brown sugar, diced apples, etc. (and fyi, to this very day I totally hate the stuff\u2026.yep, \u2018tis true). For breakfast, my family and I ate things like spicy tofu soup, oxtail soup, rice and kimchi, rice porridge, this is just how I grew up!\u2026but I digress. Something we did always seem to have around for a quick and easy \u201cbreakfast\u201d was super sugary Cinnamon Toast Crunch\u2026.and Corn Pops and Rice Krispies and Cap\u2019n Crunch \u2026but Cinnamon Toast Crunch was by far my absolute favorite! I always felt like I was eating a cinnamon roll when eating a bowl of this cereal\u2026.and whenever I\u2019d get to the bottom of the bowl, I was always more than happy to suck down the remaining cinnamon-sugar milk. So Good! Anyway, I thought it would be fun to create sort of a throwback to one of my favorite childhood cereals, so today we have \u201cCinnamon Toast Crunch Coffee Cake Bites\u201d. I wanted to stay in the realm of sweet breakfasts and bite-sized anythings, because small is awesome! If you\u2019re worried about the bites themselves sticking to the muffin tin, then go ahead and use mini liners and peel them off the bites once they cool before turning them upside down and glazing them. These are really great with or without the streusel center, so it\u2019s really up to you; the streusel helps to incorporate the actual cereal into the recipe more as well as imparts a great flavor and texture.   I hope you guys make a batch of these this weekend while thinking about your favorite sugary cereal growing up\u2026.and those cheesy commercials! xx, Jenny Cinnamon Toast Crunch Coffee Cake Bites Makes 32

VHi All! Now that summer\u2019s unofficially here I feel everyone (myself included) making the most of the warm/sunny weather and trying to take advantage of \u201ccity/town events\u201d. Here are a few of my summer bucket list to dos: -bike to the beach, at least once a week -eat oysters at the beach, at least once a week -take Dexter on walks to the beach, at least once a week -grab a craft beer at my favorite dive bar on the pier, at least once a week -partake in champagne brunches at the beach/pier, at least once a week -overcome my fear of killer sea lions and go paddle boating/kayaking\u2026ONCE. Notice a common theme in my summer \u201cbucket list\u201d? Yea, I plan on spending most of my free time down by the beach. Picnicking on the beach is also something I love to do. When I pack a meal for a beach picnic I like to pack things that transport well, that aren\u2019t completely temperature sensitive and that can also be considered \u201csnacky\u201d. These Korean-Style Cocktail Meatballs are something I love packing on picnics as well as bringing as hors\u2019dourves to any cocktail party. They\u2019re bite sized, filled with tons of great flavor and have a unique twist to them with the gochujang glaze. You can adjust the spiciness in the glaze by scaling down on the chile paste and adding more sugar as needed. This is a great little cocktail treat that\u2019s really easy to whip together and bring to a party, or just pack them up and enjoy them with someone special! xx Jenny Korean-Style Cocktail Meatballs with a Sweet and Spicy Gochujang Glaze Serves 5 to 7

VDirections:\u000a
p16516
aV1. Preheat oven to 425°F.\u000a
p16517
aV2. For crust: Place flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder into a food processor and pulse together. Add cream cheese and butter and pulse until a fine mealy texture has been formed. Add the water and vinegar and pulse until a dough forms. Form dough into a disc and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for an hour. Roll dough onto a lightly floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut 24, 2 inch squares from the dough and form into 1 inch tart molds, trimming the edges of excess dough as needed. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.\u000a
p16518
aV3. For the filling: Place all ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir together until fully combined. Pour mixture into prepared shells and completely fill.\u000a
p16519
aV4. Bake mini pies for 10 minutes. Lower temperature to 350°F and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until the pies have set in the center and the crusts are golden brown. Allow to cool for about an hour before topping each with a dollop of whipped cream and serving.\u000a
p16520
aVDirections:\u000a
p16521
aV1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease two mini muffin tins and set aside.\u000a
p16522
aV2. In a medium mixing bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, all-spice, and salt. Set aside.\u000a
p16523
aV3. In another mixing bowl combine oil and sugars and whisk together. Add eggs and vanilla and continue to whisk together.\u000a
p16524
aV4. In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, orange zest and juice.\u000a
p16525
aV5. Alternately add dry mixture and yogurt mixture to sugar mixture, in thirds until fully incorporated. Fill each muffin tin 2/3 way and bake for 20 to 25 minute or until a toothpick come out clean when inserted into the center of the cakes. Allow cakes to cool before removing cakes from tin and flip each over some they\u2019re standing top down.\u000a
p16526
aV6. For the glaze: In a small bowl stir together the pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add powdered sugar and stir until fully incorporated (using a fork over a whisk is recommended to avoid air bubbles).\u000a
p16527
aV7. To assemble: Pour about 1 teaspoon of the pumpkin glaze over each orange-spice cake and finish with a sprinkle of pistachios. Allow glaze to set before serving.\u000a
p16528
aVDirections:\u000a
p16529
aV1. Place ice cream, pie, milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a blender and blend until smooth.\u000a
p16530
aV2. Pour milkshakes into 2 ounce glasses and top with a dollop of whipped cream (can use piping bag if preferred). Finish with a sprinkle of crumbled pie crust and serve immediately.\u000a

VHey Guys! So\u2026it\u2019s still really hot out\u2026wtf! I\u2019m totally ready for fall\u2026forget this, \u201cI just don\u2019t want summer to end\u201d BS\u2026I\u2019m OVER IT! Okay, I apologize for being aggressive right there, but man does this weather make me grumpy. There are a few things that get my mood up during weather like this: 1) My Dog (always) 2) Frequent Fro-Yo and Hawaiian Ice trips with the boyfriend 3) This Roasted Onion Dip. Remember when you were a kid and sleepovers were still the best thing ever? I do\u2026and I also remember despite facials, mani/pedi\u2019s and trying to \u201crejuvenate\u201d our 13 year old selves there was A LOT of junk food around: pizza, pop, cookies, bin candy, potato chips, and that fake, weird, terrible for you yet embarrassingly delicious jar of French onion dip. I\u2019m not quite sure what it was about that dip, but that magical sauce made it to almost all of my tween sleepovers. These days, I\u2019m not much into creamy dips like that (except for artichoke dip\u2026.that one will always have me heart)\u2026I\u2019m not sure why, I\u2019m just not. What I am totally into is this version of one of my childhood favorite dips, made healthier. I\u2019m really into using Greek yogurt to sub mayonnaise or sour cream as often as I can and although there is still some sour cream in there to give the dip a smoother texture, it\u2019s mostly Greek yogurt\u2026.I really heart Greek yogurt\u2026.and this dip. If you are willing to brave a hot kitchen for about an hour (woof, I know), this dip is totally worth it and a delicious treat to help keep you cool (once you\u2019re sitting and enjoying it) and leave you feeling guilt-less afterwards! Hope everyone\u2019s keeping cool! Enjoy xx Jenny Roasted Onion Dip Serves 5 to 6

VHey guys! Today I\u2019m jumping right into the recipe because I\u2019m really excited about it. We have strawberry shortcake cookies topped with vanilla glaze for you! I have to admit, I hadn\u2019t actually tasted my first strawberry shortcake until culinary school, about 4 years ago\u2026I know\u2026.BUT I did grow up obsessed with the books, especially the scented ones that were also plastic with a sponge lining so you could take the book into the bath with you to smell and read it, which I now think are a little weird/creepy or maybe I\u2019ve just been watching too much Law and Order: SVU lately\u2026.I digress. ANYWAY, I\u2019ve been on a pretty big Greek yogurt kick lately\u2026 I mean, I\u2019ve always had a thing for Greek yogurt, but I\u2019ve recently become super into using it in my cooking/baking. Today I\u2019ve replaced my egg and milk for Greek yogurt AND just like in regular shortcake recipes the amount of sugar in the whole batch is pretty low\u2026.yay, for sorta healthier cookies! :) These cookies are great, really! My boyfriend even looked at me with bright eyes the second he took his first bite and said, \u201cOh wow, these are delightful!\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him use the word \u201cdelightful\u201d before\u2026ever, so I\u2019m going to take that as a good thing. They\u2019re super light and fluffy and the strawberries are both sweet and slightly tart which is great with the thin, sweet glaze. They\u2019re really great for any occasion and now that the weather around my parts has cooled off a bit I\u2019m not terrified to turn my oven on anymore! Woo!! I think I may even like these cookies better than the cake itself, but I\u2019m also a little bias\u2026.you all should bake these and let me know what you think\u2026yes? maybe? please?! Enjoy! xx Jenny Strawberry Shortcake Cookies Makes 20-24

aV2. Place strawberries, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar into a small mixing bowl and toss together until well coated. Place in refrigerator and set aside.\u000a
p16712
aV3. In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the remaining flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in the butter until a fine/even, grainy texture forms.\u000a
p16713
aV4. Stir in the Greek yogurt and vanilla and mix until just combined. Fold in the strawberry mixture and lemon zest and mix until well combined.\u000a
p16714
aV5. Line a baking sheet with parchment and spoon on 2 tablespoons of dough at a time, about 1 inch apart.\u000a
p16715
aV6. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes or until the cookies have barely started to brown on top. Remove from the oven and transfer cookies onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.\u000a
p16716
aV7. While the cookies cool, make the glaze: Place the sugar, milk and vanilla into a small bowl and gently stir together with a fork until no lumps remain. Drizzle glaze over cookies and serve or allow to set, about 30 minutes, before serving.\u000a

aVI have to admit, I hadn\u2019t actually tasted my first strawberry shortcake until culinary school, about 4 years ago\u2026I know\u2026.BUT I did grow up obsessed with the books, especially the scented ones that were also plastic with a sponge lining so you could take the book into the bath with you to smell and read it, which I now think are a little weird/creepy or maybe I\u2019ve just been watching too much Law and Order: SVU lately\u2026.I digress.
p16720
aVANYWAY, I\u2019ve been on a pretty big Greek yogurt kick lately\u2026 I mean, I\u2019ve always had a thing for Greek yogurt, but I\u2019ve recently become super into using it in my cooking/baking.
p16721
aVToday I\u2019ve replaced my egg and milk for Greek yogurt AND just like in regular shortcake recipes the amount of sugar in the whole batch is pretty low\u2026.yay, for sorta healthier cookies!

VHappy Wednesday! I hope everyone had a very filling Thanksgiving. I am super pumped about Christmas / Holiday season. I am the person who gets the Christmas stuff out the day after Thanksgiving, and I get really excited when I see ornaments at Rite Aid. Then you know it\u2019s all really happening. This year, we are going to really bring it with some yummy cookie recipes for you guys, as well as some gift giving make your own \u2013 do it yourself- situations. So get ready. First up are these Chocolate Chip Rice Krispies Treat Cookies. Like most of you, I am a really big fan of rice krispies treats. So making them into cookies with chocolate was kinda a no brainer. Super yum. The rice krispies make the cookies amazingly chewy, and the chunks of marshmallow and chocolate are awesome little flavor pockets as you eat your way through. Hope you all enjoy! \u2665 Teri RECIPE UPDATE:  Hi Guys! After reading many of your comments about the cookies turning into nut lace sitches, I went back and figured out the issue. I added way to much butter to flour when I typed this up. The new recipe should yield 3 dozen, non-nut lace cookies. :) They still spread, so beware of that, but not as much and they\u2019re great! Sorry for the blooper and thanks for your patience, everyone! xx, Jenny Chocolate Chip Rice Krispies Treat Cookies Makes about 3 dozen

VHi guys! So holiday season is upon us (<~ total typical words around now, sorry) and I\u2019m so excited! I love seeing lights go up everywhere and decorations popping up here and there. This time of year is always so much fun AND stressful. How that works out, I\u2019m not sure\u2026all I know is that I get both super excited and stressed out during the holidays. Lately when I\u2019ve been feeling stressed I\u2019ve been doing the worst thing possible\u2026stress eating!! I try to keep it healthy when I stress eat, but that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes to calm my nerves I make fancy snacks to eat at home, like this yellowtail crudo! There\u2019s just something about making these super simple, yet slightly elevated dishes that make me very happy. What can I say, it\u2019s the little things. :) This is similar to our  other crudo dish  with uni and scallops in that it is much less expensive to make this dish at home and it\u2019s quick and easy. I love the creaminess of yellowtail and love pairing it with bold flavors and textures like tart pomegranate and bitter/crisp radishes. The shiso oil in this dish makes it really special, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with making your own, I light drizzle of a flavorful olive oil is just fine. During this crazy holiday time, I recommend you throw in a dish like this here and there for one of the many holiday parties we will all be throwing/attending. It\u2019s a yummy and unexpected dish that will fill you up, but not leave you feeling heavy and gross. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Yellowtail and Pomegranate Crudo with Shiso Oil Serves 3 to 4

VWe all know that with the holiday season comes parties and parties and fake smiling, and makeup, and high heels, and food. So some things are about holidays are awesome, and some things about holidays are not. On the good side, I would put all the delicious food you get to eat, and make. These little tartlets are just for those times. You know when you make cookies, you eat the dough? Or when you make frosting, you lick the spoon? So while you\u2019re assembling these I suggest you take a slice of pear and top it with some cheese and maybe even some of the port reduction. It will be a good snack for you while you wait for these to get out of the oven. These are seriously so yummy, and very pretty. The marriage of the flavors is really perfect, and it is so easy to make. Consider it for your next party. Also, just so you remember, we have a TON of appetizer foods in our recipe index if you\u2019re in the market! \u2665 Teri Asian Pear Tartlets with a Spiced Port Reduction Makes about 9 (2 1/2\u201d tartlets)

VHey Guys! This past weekend the boyfriend and I took a little weekend getaway to Idyllwild, Ca. It\u2019s a tiny mountain town close to Temecula and Palm Springs (think Big Bear scaled down a lot and minus the snow boarding) and can I just say, I\u2019m totally in love! It really is a teeny-tiny town filled with gorgeous, scenic hiking trails and cute snow capped mountains. It was just a quick 2 hour drive inland and we stayed in a private two-story cottage with Strawberry creek just a stones throw away from our back patio. Needless to say I was in my happy place, doing my happy dance ALL.WEEKEND.LONG. On top of the super friendly people, really cute accommodations and gorgeous weather we experienced\u2026the town is OOBER dog friendly!!!\u2026.Like so much so that their mayor is A DOG!!! I really love it when little towns like this say, \u201cScrew it, we\u2019re electing the golden retriever Max as the mayor.\u201d Okay, so the decision probably wasn\u2019t made like that but still, how awesome, right?! This was seriously one of the most relaxing weekends I\u2019ve had in a long time\u2026.aside from the romantic, turned terrifying night walks we took along the woods\u2026in pitch black\u2026.yep. One thing about tiny towns like this, little to no street lights; very freaky stuff, especially if you\u2019re afraid of the dark (small secret: I\u2019m terrified of the dark\u2026like I turn into a big baby\u2026..[yet LOVE horror films]\u2026.but more on all that on another day). Aside from the \u201cfearing for my life night walks\u201d I did miss the exotic flavor punched meals that I\u2019m so used to getting in LA. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I had some great meals up there like a porcini and ricotta ravioli with a browned butter and sage sauce, osso bucco and a triple berry panna cotta. All of these dishes were pretty memorable to me, but my Korean roots were missing the ethnic and the spice. Ah yes, you\u2019ll fine a large amount of American and Italian-American fare up in Idyllwild (I think there is one chinese restaurant there?), which is absolutely A-OK, but for a spice freak such as myself I was anxious to come home to something decadent, but not so \u201cstick to yer ribs\u201d. That finally brings me to today\u2019s cookies. I ate three of these right when I got home and it really hit the spot. These earthquake cookies are special because they\u2019re studded with cinnamon, cayenne and chile powder, along with the bits of Mexican chocolate already swirled together with the dark chocolate. They pack a really nice, warm sweetness with hints of spice here and there that really dance on your tongue. The crisp exterior is great with the soft and chewy center of the cookies\u2026yum! If you\u2019re looking for an awesome but slightly unusual, flavor packed cookie, I think this is it for you! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Mexican Chocolate Earthquake Cookies Makes about 3 dozen

VDirections:\u000a
p16965
aV1. Preheat oven to 325°F.\u000a
p16966
aV2. In a double boiler over medium heat melt chocolates and butter together until smooth. Stir in coffee, cinnamon, cayenne, and chile powder and stir until fully incorporated. Set aside and allow chocolate mixture to cool slightly.\u000a
p16967
aV3. While chocolate mixture melts, combine almond meal, flour, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Set aside.\u000a
p16968
aV4. Place the eggs and sugar into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or in a mixing bowl with a hand mixer and mix until the mixture has thickened and become a pale yellow color, 5 to 6 minutes.\u000a
p16969
aV5. With the motor running, begin pouring the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, in a slow and steady stream (to prevent curdling) until fully incorporated.\u000a
p16970
aV6. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the flour mixture until fully incorporated. Pour the batter into a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap (at this point the mixture will be loose).\u000a
p16971
aV7. Allow mixture to chill for at least 3 hours before using.\u000a
p16972
aV8. Once mixture has chilled, use a cookie scooper to scoop out 1 tablespoon sized balls.\u000a
p16973
aV9. Quickly roll them in the granulated sugar, followed by the powdered sugar until fully covered and place the on a parchment lined baking sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart, the cookies will spread (Tip: try to handle the \u201ccookie dough\u201d as little as possible and with cold hands, as they have a similar consistency to ganache and will melt in your hands quickly)\u000a
p16974
aV10. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the cookies have spread, leaving a fun \u201cearthquake\u201d effect on the tops of the cookies. Allow the cookies to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They should be slightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.\u000a

VHi guys! Were any of you girl scouts? boy scouts? I was a girl scout for one year, 4th grade. Troop 428. There was one and only one reason I wanted to join girl scouts\u2026.the outfits. I was totally obsessed with the knee socks, the skirts, even the vest and sash\u2026.I wanted it ALL. My mom decided she would humor my girl scout clothing obsession by letting me join one year, with the exception that I was going to learn the true meaning of being a girl scout, etc, etc\u2026..such a good mom thing to say. Anyway, that day magical came\u2026I was FINALLY going to pick out and being sporting my cute new outfit everywhere. I could barely contain myself, I was freaking out. I ran into the store and suddenly it was like the blackest cloud sailed over me\u2026.where were the knee socks? the skirts?\u2026.and why was there so much FLORAL PRINTED CLOTHING EVERYWHERE??? That year the girl scouts decided to \u201ctry something new\u201d to \u201cupdate their look\u201d by introducing a new line of clothes that consisted of floral leggings, green sweatshirts with \u201cGirl Scouts\u201d printed on them in floral and white t-shirts with the same print. Needless to say I could feel my cheeks getting hot and the tears welding up in my eyes. I tried as hard as I could to hold them back, because man was I going to look like a spoiled brat, crying over the new girl scouts outfits\u2026.but I couldn\u2019t help it. I sadly picked out everything I needed and dragged my feet back to the car. I wish I could say that my experience in girl scouts totally made up for my traumatic experience, but it didn\u2019t. My group leaders were not into it at all, making it not fun for us kids. We really didn\u2019t do much of anything except sit in small groups and talk about our day\u2026.while dressed in floral printed sweats. The philanthropic aspect of it seemed to escape us as well. We didn\u2019t really receive any guidance from our leaders about the badges, which was really weird. Now I\u2019m totally not knocking girl/boy scouts, I think overall it\u2019s a really great program for young kids and I have many friends who were girl scouts and friends who were boy scouts and absolutely LOVED IT!\u2026\u2026I just had quite an interesting experience. One of the best things about girl scouts, doesn\u2019t matter who you are, are the cookies\u2026no doubt! Who doesn\u2019t freak out in excitement when you see those little girls standing out in front of grocery stores, just waiting to take all your money?! It\u2019s just a bummer that you can\u2019t get them year round\u2026well I guess you can e-bay them and stuff, but that\u2019s a little intense even for me. This year we\u2019ve solved the problem of not being able to have girl scout cookies all year long, by making homemade versions of three of our favorite kinds! Yep, that\u2019s right\u2026we have them for you! Just a fair warning that while these are easy cookie recipes, the assembly does take a little bit of work\u2026especially the caramel delight cookies\u2026but trust me, they\u2019re totally worth it! Maybe stick a few of these in a holiday gift pack for friends, family or co-workers? They\u2019ll love ya for it\u2026promise! xx, Jenny Homemade Caramel Delite Cookies Makes 48 Homemade Thanks-A-Lots Makes 48 Homemade Thin Mints Makes 48

VHi Guys! Do any of you have weird childhood snacks that have stuck with you all these years? I do. When my sister and I were little we were (and still sort of are) obsessed with Yan-Yans; her with the strawberry and me with chocolate, always and always. Every time we went to the Asian market with our mom, we knew we\u2019d each be walking out of the store holding a container of yan-yans\u2026oh the good old days. :) If you know what yan-yans are you\u2019re cool and I like you\u2026.if you don\u2019t, its okay\u2026just think \u201cdunkaroos\u201d but replace the kangaroo cookies with yummy biscuit sticks and add two more frosting flavors and mulitple the awesomeness by 20. That\u2019s it. Anyway, yan-yans are totally awesome and these homemade versions are super simple to make! I should warn that each frosting recipe makes quite a lot of frosting so you may want to scale back on each or just make one flavor. The consistency is thinner than regular frosting to make the sticks easy to dip, but you could always thicken it up with a bit more powdered sugar and have some really great strawberry, chocolate and vanilla-bean frostings for your baked goods too! Oh yan-yans, I love you\u2026and I totally hope you all love them too! xx Jenny Homemade Yan-Yans with a Trio of Frosting Serves 6 to 8

VWhen my sister and I were little we were (and still sort of are) obsessed with Yan-Yans; her with the strawberry and me with chocolate, always and always.

aVThe consistency is thinner than regular frosting to make the sticks easy to dip, but you could always thicken it up with a bit more powdered sugar and have some really great strawberry, chocolate and vanilla-bean frostings for your baked goods too!
p17171
aV:) If you know what yan-yans are you\u2019re cool and I like you\u2026.if you don\u2019t, its okay\u2026just think \u201cdunkaroos\u201d but replace the kangaroo cookies with yummy biscuit sticks and add two more frosting flavors and mulitple the awesomeness by 20.
p17172
aVI should warn that each frosting recipe makes quite a lot of frosting so you may want to scale back on each or just make one flavor.

VHey guys! So I think I should clarify something\u2026.. I don\u2019t hate Valentine\u2019s Day. Really. After Monday\u2019s post a friend of mine called me to ask if everything was okay with the boyfriend and I\u2026.when I told her \u201cyes! \u201c and asked why, she said it\u2019s because it seemed like I was hating on V-day in my last post. I chuckled. So here\u2019s a little clarification. I don\u2019t hate Valentine\u2019s Day. I think it\u2019s a cute, albeit fake, holiday! My issue isn\u2019t about the day itself, celebrating love, etc.; my issue is all the pressure it seems to put on people/couples to go hard and celebrate in the biggest way possible. If that\u2019s what you and your partner want to do\u2026GREAT! I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, that\u2019s all\u2026just do what ya feel like doin\u2019, that\u2019s all. :) Now to these little \u201cDeviled Hearts\u201d\u2026no bake cheesecake stuffed strawberries are nothing new. Totally delicious, but nothing new. We\u2019re adding our own twist to this yummy dessert, by splitting them down the middle, scooping out the centers and piping the filling straight into them\u2026.\u201dDeviled Hearts\u201d\u2026get it?! Just like the panna cotta from Monday, this dessert is SUPER easy (seriously takes 15 minutes, tops) and REALLY addicting. I actually made a very similar recipe for a upcoming issue of a popular food magazine (more on that as the issue approaches!) and when testing these\u2026lets just say the boyfriend (aka, the taste tester) down 16 of them in one sitting\u2026.16! I also made these for the super bowl, but as a dip sitch and as soon as I set the platter out, people were huddling around it until they were gone\u2026.so I think we have a winner here! I\u2019ve made these \u201cNew York Style\u201d by adding a good amount of sour cream and lemon zest (I just love the tang). Folding the whipped cream into the mixture is key as it\u2019ll give you a light and fluffy filling! If you\u2019re looking for a last minute V-Day dessert\u2026I recommend these! They\u2019re a cute V-day dessert, but you can really make them for any occasion! I hope everyone has a fun and safe Valentine\u2019s Day, doing whatever the heck y\u2019all want! ;) xx, Jenny Deviled Hearts Makes 32

VI went to Portland this weekend for quick 1.5 day trip. A total surprise to me, and it was kind of in celebration of my birthday. I really don\u2019t like getting super really scary close to 30 in age, so birthdays now have just become a date to look forward to and be depressed about. Anyway, obviously in Portland I just ate a lot of food, felt really overly full and tried to understand why I do this to my self. Why do I eat so much that when we get back to the hotel it is so uncomfortable I want to cry? I think this is what being pregnant must feel like, a little. Portland was fun, I want to go back and experience more of it.  We had quite a bit of seafood while we were there, in so many different forms I feel totally inspired. That is why today I happy we are sharing this great Cornmeal Mustard Shrimp recipe with you. I am a big fan of cornmeal because of texture, and because of corn dogs. Mustard is something I grew up really not liking, but as an adult, I really love it. These two things married with shrimp it becomes one of those killer must try appetizer situations. I hope you all agree. \u2665 Teri Cornmeal Crusted Mustard Shrimp with Triple Blanched Garlic Aioli Serves 4 to 6

VHi Guys! Did everyone have a good weekend? I had a weekend of beaching it, dog park-ing it, and farmers market-ing it. It was a pretty cool weekend and I\u2019m super pumped for next weekend. Teri and I are heading off to Austin for the Food and Wine Festival and we\u2019re stoked! I\u2019m so excited to see what different chefs and restaurants will be bringing to their booths and I\u2019m even more excited to become inspired by some of the dishes and do some recreates when I get home!\u2026or attempt to at least! :)So I would love to tell you that these Blueberry Yogurt Cookies we have today come with a fun story or somehow relate to our exciting upcoming weekend\u2026but really, I had a craving to bake cookies using fruit and yogurt last week and so I did. Simple as that. I really love using Greek yogurt to replace butter in recipes (and sometimes even the egg) where I can do it, in the same way I really like to replace sugar for things like raw honey or pure maple syrup. Even if it\u2019s not necessarily healthier for you it just makes me feel better. Plus, I love the soft, moist texture you get from using yogurt in baked goods. We made some  strawberry shortcake cookies  a while back and I wanted to have another go at it, but this time I wanted the cookies to be even lighter and softer in texture (the shortcake cookies are sort of a biscuit, cookie, scone, hybrid). I love the flavors of blueberries and lemon so I used both for these cookies. The flavor combo is just so classic and so good.These Blueberry Yogurt Cookies are not terribly sweet so I topped them with swedish pearl sugars for their sweetness, crunch and overall cuteness. You can fine the pearled sugar at specialty bake shops or online and they\u2019re pretty reasonable in price. If you don\u2019t want to go the pearled sugar route, but you want your cookies to have some added sweetness you can always make the  strawberry shortcake cookie glaze  (with maybe even some lemon zest, yum) and drizzle it atop these cookies. If you\u2019re looking for an easy, delicious and low maintenance cookie I urge you to try these little guys out! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Blueberry-Yogurt Cookies Makes about 40

V:)So I would love to tell you that these Blueberry Yogurt Cookies we have today come with a fun story or somehow relate to our exciting upcoming weekend\u2026but really, I had a craving to bake cookies using fruit and yogurt last week and so I did.
p17413
aVI really love using Greek yogurt to replace butter in recipes (and sometimes even the egg) where I can do it, in the same way I really like to replace sugar for things like raw honey or pure maple syrup.
p17414
aVI love the flavors of blueberries and lemon so I used both for these cookies.
p17415
aVThe flavor combo is just so classic and so good.These Blueberry Yogurt Cookies are not terribly sweet so I topped them with swedish pearl sugars for their sweetness, crunch and overall cuteness.
p17416
aVYou can fine the pearled sugar at specialty bake shops or online and they\u2019re pretty reasonable in price.

VIt\u2019s Friday. Yes! It\u2019s been a really long and exhausting week. I\u2019ve been holed up in my kitchen frying, grinding and candying 40 lbs of bacon, grinding and seasoning about 3 hogs worth of chicharrones and a number of other kind of weird things, with a couple photo shoots scattered throughout the weeks cooking madness. Needless to say, my kitchen\u2019s a mess, my back hurts and I\u2019m so ready for this weekend\u2026.and this poutine. Oh poutine, what a glorious, glorious dish you are. French fries topped with whatever you want and eaten as a meal. Genius. This stuff is literally what dreams are made of and the 12 yr old fat kid in me freaks out every time it graces a menu. The awesome thing about poutine also is that I think each time i\u2019ve had it, it\u2019s been completely different. I\u2019ve had the basic French fry, gravy and cheese curd poutine, all the way to a Mexican style carnitas one that reminding me more of loaded nachos than poutine! Poutine possibilities are endless! Today we have one with braised short ribs\u2026black garlic braised short ribs. Can we talk black garlic for just a sec? I feel like black garlic had it\u2019s moment as a food trend ingredient about two years ago, where black garlic roasted chicken was EVERYWHERE and then it went away. Oh how I hate \u201cfood trends\u201d\u2026but I won\u2019t go down that dark road\u2026not today at least. ;) I grew up with black garlic and if you have never had it\u2026oh man, its really awesome! It\u2019s basically garlic that has been fermented\u2026.yep, us Koreans LOVE to ferment! :) The flavor you get from black garlic is very different and not too reminiscent of \u201ctypical\u201d garlic. It has a very umami taste to it (for lack of a better word), with what almost seems like hints of smokiness. You can find it at some specialty markets, Asian markets and even markets like Whole Foods carry it, depending on where you live. We\u2019ll also be posting a tutorial in the nearish future, so look out for that! Anyway, back to awesome poutine! The black garlic flavor in the short ribs is very subtle, but really tasty! We\u2019ve swapped out cheese curds for oaxaca because I LOVE the sharp, salty flavor and it melts SO well! The braise recipe itself is great on its own\u2026paired with some mashed potatoes and roasted veg. and you\u2019ve got dinner!\u2026then maybe make some poutine with the leftovers\u2026just maybe. If you\u2019re looking to indulge and totally \u201ctreat yoself\u201d you\u2019ve found the perfect dish for that! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Black Garlic Braised Short Rib Poutine Serves 4 to 6

p17499
aV1. Preheat oven to 325°F.\u000a
p17500
aV2. Place butter and flour in a small bowl and using the back of a fork, mash together until fully combined. Set aside until ready to use. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons oil into a large Dutch oven and place over medium-high heat.\u000a
p17501
aV3. Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper and sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove short ribs from pot and set aside.\u000a
p17502
aV4. Drain excess fat from pan and add remaining oil. Add onions, carrots and celery and sauté for about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add 10 cloves black garlic, and ginger and continue to sauté for an additional 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and thyme and stir.\u000a
p17503
aV5. Deglaze pot with red wine, making sure to scrape any browned bits that may have stuck to the bottom, with a wooden spoon. Boil until liquid has been reduced by one third. Add short ribs back to the pot, in a single layer and top with broth.\u000a
p17504
aV6. Add the cinnamon stick, star anise and brown sugar and stir together. Bring to a boil, cover and place into the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until ribs are fork tender.\u000a
p17505
aV7. Remove short ribs from braising liquid and set aside. Skim excess fat from top of braising liquid and remove cinnamon stick and anise. Pour liquid into a blender (leave the center cap off and replace it with a damp towel, folded a couple times and your hand placed over it\u2026 this will prevent your blender top from exploding off [ due to the steam] as you blend) or using an immersion blender, add remaining cloves of black garlic and blend together until smooth. Return puree back to the pot and simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk in butter-flour mixture until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth and glossy. (if gravy is too thick you can thin it out with some beef stock and adjust the seasonings)\u000a
p17506
aV8. Remove bones and excess fat from short ribs and shred with two forks. (or my preferred way\u2026.with your hands!) Ladle 1 1/2 cups of gravy over shredded meat and toss together, add cheese and continue to toss together.\u000a
p17507
aV9. To assemble: Place a mound of fries onto a baking sheet and top with short rib mixture. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese just melts. Top with more gravy and sliced chives. Serve.\u000a

VSometimes the world becomes an exhausting place to exist. Sometimes it seems like everything is not on your side, and things are just not going your way. Like when you\u2019re in the middle of a really good episode of West Wing and your Netflix stops buffering and then it tells you the show is unavailable. Or when your cheap landlord blames a broken sink handle on you when its really because the sink has probably been there since 1923. Or when your landlord then asks you if you\u2019re expecting because you are wearing a baggy shirt and unattractive sweats. That\u2019s cool. That\u2019s fun, and that is life. Sometimes though, when life gives you lemons, you just want to hurl them with everything you\u2019ve got at your landlords face, because you know what? I don\u2019t feel like making lemonade. Sometimes, when life happens, you have to make something delicious so that you yourself can eat it all, and not give any to anyone else. Sometimes for me, those little gifts of deliciousness are something savory, and sometimes they are really effing cute, and puffy, and perfectly sized so I can eat like a million. Sometimes those little \u2018make it all ok\u2019 treats are these Sun Dried Tomato Olive & Goat Cheese Palmiers. When life happens, eat cute things.

VHi Guys! So two nights ago I was lucky enough to see Anthony Bourdain and Roy Choi speak at the Pantages in LA. Did anyone else go? and did anyone else have the best time listening to the ever articulate and brilliant Tony Bourdain and totally awesome and badass Chef Choi?! I loved it! It\u2019s always so refreshing to see and hear two people you look up to so much, pretty much just shooting the shit for 2 hours on stage. Even the audience q&a (which normally I HATE bc man, people can ask some really mundane and self-involved questions and it really sucks sometimes) was really fun and interesting\u2026some people asked really great questions! It was also no matter that I was on a shoot earlier that day that ended up over 50 miles away from the theater! Luckily, the boyfriend was meeting me at the theater bc of the time, bc he probably would\u2019ve had a heart attack in the car with me. I may have been dangerously weaving through cars and I may have been blazing down the freeway much faster than I should be going\u2026.but absolutely nothing was going to keep me from attending an event with my boyfriend\u2026. to watch my other two boyfriends, Tony and Roy, speak. :) Some of you may know this, some of you may not, but Roy Choi is my current favorite chef. Yes, I\u2019m a little bias because part of my love, for both him (and David Chang for that matter) does stem from the fact that he is an outstanding and creative Korean-American chef, but more so because of the way Chef Choi looks at food and different places he finds his day to day inspiration. I love that he once wrote in an interview how he had an epiphany about how his whole culinary career is based off his obsession with milkshakes!  \u201cIt\u2019s my nostalgia, but I like blending shit up\u2026.. All the Kogi stuff, the sauces and marinades, are all blended. We blend it in a bucket. All my sauces at A-frame. I\u2019m tripping out, man. I\u2019m starting to see how everything I do is blended. It has to go back to milkshakes.\u201d  (quote source from firstwefeast.com) How awesome is that?!?! In the recent (well for the last year) Chef Choi has gone vegetarian in a sense (still eats meat in dishes offered to him, presented to him, but hasn\u2019t ordered a meat dish in about a year) and when it first came out he was highly criticized for turning him back on something that made him oober successful \u201ckogi\u201d, which translates to \u201cmeat\u201d. You know what I say to the nay sayers? Get off his back! (see my creepy obsession starting to build?) He\u2019s not turning his back on meat or his successful food trucks as well as his booming restaurants; he\u2019s simply made a personal decision for himself and i\u2019m excited. Why? In my mind, a true chef isn\u2019t measured by the best savory, rich meat dish he/she can make (bc lets be serious, if we all used bacon fat, duck fat, etc in our cooking, everyone\u2019s food would taste amazing), but by the best salad/side dish they can make. No joke. I think it\u2019s much more difficult to push a salad than it is to push roasted bone marrow with buttery toast points or a pappardelle and short rib ragu. So in honor of Chef Choi and his new found love of veggies we have not a salad for you today, lol, but simple and delicious blistered shishito peppers. I love these things and I love them blistered. I\u2019ve started to see them as small appetizers around a few LA restaurants and that\u2019s exciting. Shishito peppers are a sweeter variety of Japanese peppers with a neat \u201ctwisted-like\u201d shape. When you blister them, (either on a grill or in a cast iron skillet), they get a really nice smokey aroma to them and soften just the right amount. For these peppers, I like keeping things super simple and let the peppers speak for themselves. Nothing but a little sesame oil, salt and pepper. Yum-town. Not only is this snack delicious and easily transportable (mid afternoon work snack? Yes, please), but it\u2019s seriously a 10 minute recipe from start to finish. I\u2019m pretty sure these are going to be my new go to healthy snack and hopefully they\u2019re Roy Choi approved. :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Blistered Shishito Peppers Serves 4 to 6

VWe are very excited because this weekend we are trekking it to Austin, hanging with friends, and going to the Austin Food and Wine Festival to eat lots of good food. I have just purchased a pair of \u2018chambray\u2019 pants (more like mom pants) with a stretchy waistband that I will live in so I can eat more delicious food. Is anyone else heading over to Austin for the festival? Today we have these Beer Battered Fried Olives. I am not a huge olive fan, so if you\u2019re like me, you can totally substitute olives for pickled green beans, cocktail onions, or pickled asparagus. All those things go well with the yogurt sauce. Yum. These are a great way to fancy up your regular cocktail olives. Hope you all like it! \u2665 Teri Beer Battered Fried Olives Serves 6 to 10

VHi Guys! Today we have peppadew poppers! Okay so technically these guys are called \u2018cherry peppers\u2019 or \u2018pimentos\u2019 and \u2018peppadews\u2019 are technically the trademarked brand name of a company based out of South Africa\u2026but as cute as pimentos and cherry peppers sound, I think peppadew sounds the cutest! Also, I got actual peppadews for this recipe, but please note that you can use any variety of pickled cherry peppers/pimentos and it\u2019ll be just as great! Anyway, why these? why now? Eh, because every now and then you need to \u201ctreat yoself\u201d and this is totally one of those treats. They\u2019re super easy to whip up and I know the deep frying factor is a buzz kill for many of you, but you really only need a small pot with a few inches of oil and the process is not all that messy\u2026or doesn\u2019t have to be! You can try to bake these, but I haven\u2019t tried yet and I\u2019m not sure if the filling will come bursting out of them or not\u2026other than that issue, they should hold well in the oven. :) I recently went over my love for all things pickled when we posted our  Rhubarb Pickles  and these are no exception. Pickled peppadews/cherry peppers are so good! They\u2019re light and sweet with the perfect amount of briny goodness to them. Adding the rich filling and crisp out coating really makes this a lovely little snack. I also like these over jalapeno poppers because they\u2019re actually bite-sized and you can pop the whole thing in your mouth without having to worry that the cheesy filling is going to squirt out into your neighbors eye.Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy this fun and tasty little snack. I\u2019ll be making a batch this weekend while I catch up on some Arrested Development, to prepare myself for the long awaited SEASON 4. YES!!! :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Peppadew Poppers Makes 24

aV4. Place flour in a shallow bowl and repeat with the eggs and panko. Dredge the peppers into the flour followed by the eggs and finally the panko. Repeat the breading process on the cut side of each pepper so it has a double layer of breading. (this will help keep the cream cheese mixture from bursting through the breading while frying).\u000a

VHey Guys! Teri and I took ourselves a bit of a \u201cwinter break\u201d from the blog, but now we\u2019re back with some neat recipes to share with you all! We\u2019re trying our best to start this year off right by staying active and filling our bodies up with delicious, health(ier) foods. So that brings us to today\u2019s recipe. I must say I have a bit of a weakness for oober creamy spinach and artichoke dip and love snacking on the stuff, hot or cold. It\u2019s such a great comfort food for me and when I\u2019m nibbling away I usually feel like  this . Unfortunately I can feel my thighs grow the second the dip hits my lips, so this kale and artichoke dip is my healthier version of spinach and artichoke dip. It\u2019s a cold version of the dip that I make with nonfat Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and cream cheese and bulked up with sauteed kale and shallots, instead of spinach, although you could always stick with spinach if that\u2019s what you prefer. Not only are we starting the year with a delicious and healthier recipe, but we\u2019re also hosting a giveaway! Check the details out below! I hope everyone has started their 2013 with a nice, fresh and healthy start! Enjoy! xx, Jenny We are really super excited to announce we are partnering with  Turntable Kitchen  to guest curate their January pairings box. Having subscribed to their box from almost the very beginning, we have been long time fans, so when Kasey asked us to guest curate, we jumped at the opportunity. If you don\u2019t know who Turntable Kitchen is, they are a very cute couple (about to welcome a new baby girl!) Kasey and Matthew. They have this awesome  Pairings Box  they send to your door each month which includes some recipes, a premium dry ingredient so you can cook the awesome recipes, and a limited edition 7 inch vinyl. The box is so popular it is already sold out for January. So if you have not yet ordered your pairings box, the only way to get your hands on this months is to enter our giveway. YAY! So please enter below in the comments by telling us what music you love to listen to while cooking. Please note we will only ship within the US. Entries will close on Friday the 4th at 10 a.m. pst.

We ended up finding out the issue was the smokiness of the cumin\u2026 it might not be for everyone, so adjust accordingly. :)\u000a

VUnfortunately I can feel my thighs grow the second the dip hits my lips, so this kale and artichoke dip is my healthier version of spinach and artichoke dip.
p17846
aVIt\u2019s a cold version of the dip that I make with nonfat Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and cream cheese and bulked up with sauteed kale and shallots, instead of spinach, although you could always stick with spinach if that\u2019s what you prefer.

VBeing someone who is more attracted to meat than healthy stuff, I have never purposely eaten fava beans. When I say purposely I mean that I have probably had them before at some place where they shoved them into a pasta or something, but I have never gone out of my way to purchase them and prepare them. Mostly because to me they look like giant green beans, and green beans are just not that great. So I just assumed fava beans would be not that great either. I was wrong. My first experience tasting a fava bean was much like  this (one of my all time favorite scenes in Friend BTW).  At first peeling the fava beans is kind of cool kind of gross. I really couldn\u2019t decide which one it was more. The little beans to me look like spider fetus sacks or something. This is probably a personal reaction and no one else will probably feel that same way. Anyway, once you put it in your mouth its surprising because it is actually a lot sweeter and smoother than other beans. The flavor is kind of rich and refreshing. So this Favetta Crostinis topped with Smoky Sauteed Shrimp we have going on is my new favorite snack / appetizer. The colors are so pretty together right!?! The green of the fava and the pink of the shrimp. I think it\u2019s so pretty. I hope you all will give this a chance! \u2665 Teri Favetta Crostinis topped with Smoky Sautéed Shrimp Serves 5 to 7

VSome people like deep dish, some like thin. Some people like extra cheese, some people like white pizza. Some people like crusts, and some people throw them back into the pizza box like a chicken bone you just finished sucking clean. I do not understand the people that do the latter. Pizza crusts are like free bread sticks. Why would you not want to eat a free bread stick? In my opinion the ONLY reason to throw the crust away is because the good portion of the pizza is so packed with delicious stuff you want to make room for more. That is the only acceptable reason to me. That\u2019s it. So these Pizza Wheels we have going on today are amazing. Why you ask? Because there is crust ALL THE WAY AROUND, so you get crust in EVERY single bite. The cornmeal in this recipe ensures your crust is crispy and delicious, the way a legit crust should be. I am pretty obsessed with this recipe, and I feel like all you crust people will be too. If you\u2019re not so much into crust, that\u2019s ok. You\u2019re weird, but you will still love these. \u2665 Teri Pizza Wheels Makes 16-20

VHi Guys! I\u2019d like to get straight to dumplings, if that\u2019s okay\u2026 because I.LOVE.DUMPLINGS. (that should be a shirt, by the way\u2026just a thought) Yes, we have Pot Stickers for you today and they\u2019re awesome. :) I love pot stickers because they\u2019re as basic as it comes, when it comes to dumplings, and it\u2019s the type of snack you can fill with whatever suits your taste! Today\u2019s Pot Stickers recipe is sort of a mixed bag of Asian ingredients, but the dipping sauce is very Korean. Choganjang is a Korean condiment generally made of 3 parts soy sauce and 1 part vinegar. It\u2019s great to use for dipping pot stickers, but I really love adding a spoonful to hot, kimchi dumpling and rice cake soup\u2026 so good! As we get into chillier months you can guarantee we\u2019ll be sharing said soup with all you lovelies. Not only is this recipe super easy to throw together, but it\u2019s quick and delicious! These little guys also freeze really well. I love making a giant batch of these pot stickers and freezing them for whenever I want them. You can also make them slightly healthier by going full steam on them and skipping the pan frying all together. You can also skip out on \u201cfancy\u201d crimping and go straight-edged if you prefer. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Pot Stickers Makes 30

VHi Guys! I hope everyone had a great weekend AND I hope everyone is enjoying our redesign +  first video  on how to Clean and Artichoke. We\u2019re so excited now that the new site is up, because if you guys haven\u2019t noticed we have new sections that are going to bring about some fun recipe/posts/and more! Oh and ps\u2026our recipe index now includes photos! Yay, right?! It\u2019s SO much easier to find the recipes you\u2019re looking for! Anyway, back to today\u2019s recipe. Other than a cheese/charcuterie plate, this has been my go-to summer appetizer. If you invite me over to you house this summer I will most likely bring a fat platter of these. :) I really love these Grilled Peach and Burrata Crostini, they\u2019re so easy to throw together and they\u2019re so delicious! Teri and I had this out at a dinner party a few weeks back and sort of fell in love. This recipe doesn\u2019t really require \u201cmeasurements\u201d so much, but I wrote some down, just so you guys have an idea of how much of each thing you\u2019ll need so you don\u2019t run short of an ingredient as you assemble. The balsamic drizzle is totally optional. It adds a wonderful tartness to the crostini. You can also simmer the vinegar until it\u2019s reduced by about one third to one half. This will thicken the vinegar as well as bring out a nice, rich, sweetness. Again, while the additional of balsamic is great, I think this dish can totally stand on it\u2019s own. What are some of your favorite summer appetizers? I\u2019d love to hear about them! I hope you all had a great weekend and think maybe we could all use a little more grilled peach and burrata crostini in our lives, but I don\u2019t know maybe that\u2019s just me. Enjoy!  xx, Jenny Grilled Peach and Burrata Crostini Serves 8 to 12

VYou guys, this dip. THIS BASIC BRIE DIP.

You got engaged friend, yay babies!, yay raise, yay life, I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019m really happy, epic dip. I am salivating while writing this because I remember the moment when this cheesy goodness laid upon my tongue and exploded my mind. How can you go wrong with brie, really? The chives are awesome, and the pecans give a nice crunch. We paired it with crostini, and apple slices, however, this is the kind of dip you can shove anything into it and it will still be delicious. Please make this. \u2665 Teri Basic Baked Brie Dip Serves 5 to 7

VHey Guys! Is everyone getting ready for the super bowl?? As usual we\u2019re both getting ready and excited for the fun food that usually comes along with this \u201choliday\u201d sort of day\u2026.not so much the game, sorry! We feel like we\u2019ve been doing pretty well with keeping ourselves somewhat in check with the cheeseburgers, hot dogs, tater tots, and so on so just like we did this  past friday , we\u2019re treating ourselves again with these,  Fried Pork Belly and Kimchi Fried Rice Balls.  The idea for these actually came from the yummy eatery in LA,  Seoul Sausage . This place serves up some unique Korean style fusion snacks such as Galbi Poutine, a variety of awesome and unique sausages and these fried balls. :) If you haven\u2019t had a chance to try any of their food we recommend it..go with a big appetite though as you\u2019ll want to eat everything on the menu and the items are pretty filling. Our fried balls are filled with a Korean style pork and kimchi fried rice and lightly coated and fried in a crisp panko breading. These balls pack tons of delicious and intense flavor, but if the heat is a bit much for you, cool them down by dipping them in our garlic-green onion aioli! Balance, people! In addition to us getting ready for the Super Bowl, we also have a neat giveaway today! We\u2019re giving away a  QOOQ Tablet . If you\u2019ve never heard of it, it\u2019s a tablet similar to the ipad and kindle, but designed specifically for the kitchen! That\u2019s right, this tablet comes  with tons of recipes already uploaded into it, plus it constantly updates new recipes, professional chef bios/demos (according to season and availability) and much more, so you\u2019ll never have a shortage of recipes to sift through. In addition to the recipes that come pre-installed to the tablet you can also do some basic web browsing and access your personal (media) accounts. So while it\u2019s a tablet designed for the kitchen, you can still use it to access your facebook or twitter accounts! We will say this, initially we were a bit turned off by the \u201cbulkiness\u201d of this tablet. Compared to an ipad this tablet is pretty thick and heavy\u2026.BUT what we didn\u2019t consider is that fact that it is meant to stay primarily in the kitchen (to help you not only with recipes, but demo videos, organizing grocery lists, etc) and even better\u2026.it\u2019s completely spill proof! Yes, you can get \u201cspill proof\u201d covers for your other tablets, but in this case you don\u2019t need one whatsoever. It also comes with its own kickstand, for much needed convenience when you\u2019re cooking. Our favorite part about this tablet, other than the great organization and ease to search through the recipes is the sidebar on the right hand part of the screen, that includes an area for your \u201cfavorites\u201d, a basic weather report and live radio! Although the QOOQ tablet is quite a handy kitchen tool, it may not be for everyone as it is primarily specialized for kitchen use. We do urge you all to check out  their site  and decide for yourselves if it\u2019s the right tablet for you! You can also enter our giveaway today and win one for yourself by answering a a simple question in our comments section below: What is your favorite dish to make for The Super Bowl? Please note, we will only ship within the US and Entries will close on THURSDAY January 31 at 12 p.m/pst. Don\u2019t forget to leave your email in the appropriate field when you leave your comment so we can contact you when you win! Good Luck, everyone!! Kimchi Fried Rice Balls with a Garlic and Green Onion Aioli Makes 24 to 28 **UPDATE**  We have randomly chosen a winner and that person is Jennifer who said: \u201cYears ago i found a recipe called \u201csuper dip\u201d, basically a burrito filling type dip that our children always called \u201csuper bowl dip\u201d so it became our \u201cmust have\u201d for the Super Bowl. Thanks for the chance at this giveaway\u2026.a device for the kitchen sounds great!\u201d Thanks guys!

VWe feel like we\u2019ve been doing pretty well with keeping ourselves somewhat in check with the cheeseburgers, hot dogs, tater tots, and so on so just like we did this  past friday , we\u2019re treating ourselves again with these,  Fried Pork Belly and Kimchi Fried Rice Balls.

aVOur fried balls are filled with a Korean style pork and kimchi fried rice and lightly coated and fried in a crisp panko breading.

VHi Guys! Today we have something super delicious for you! Cachapas!! They\u2019re Venezuelan corn pancakes and they\u2019re amazing! Both savory with a hint of sweetness from the corn, they\u2019re also soft and very reminiscent of buttermilk pancakes in texture\u2026.light and fluffy. The boyfriend and I had this for the first time this past spring in Playa Del Carmen. We has heard of this amazing little arepa spot in town, and since I\u2019m a total whore for a good arepa, we set out for town. We were expecting to enjoy a tasty lunch and ended up with so much more. We were greeted by the owner, who was a small, but very jovial and loud man who was walking around serving guests, cleaning tabletops and singing songs. We soon learned that he was a Venezuelan gentleman who had moved to Mexico two years ago, from his homeland, to open his restaurant in an area where the competition for the type of food he was serving wasn\u2019t so high. We were pleased to hear that it was the best decision he could\u2019ve made for himself! He said since his move, his small business had really been a hit in town, plus because he rides his bike to work everyday, he had lost almost 40 lbs in his short two years in Mexico. On top of this mans good fortune in a new country, he also talked about and served his food with so much knowledge and passion. While we went into the establishment for arepas, we also ordered the cachapas, per his suggestion,\u2026filled with shredded beef and queso fresco. Delicious!!! It was light and crisp on the outside, but soft and cake-like on the inside and with the shredded beef and cheese filling, it was rich, well balanced and just perfect. Cachapas are probably one of my favorite things to eat now!\u2026especially because the filling ingredients are endless! Today I\u2019ve shrunk the cachapas down to bite-sized and topped them with a vegetarian filling\u2026I mean hello meatless monday! You can totally make a couple large ones to and stuff them if you prefer\u2026these are just party friendly, that\u2019s all.  I sauteed up a bit of red onion and poblano peppers and topped the cachapas with that mix as well as diced tomatoes, minced cilantro (a lazy man\u2019s pico de gallo) and crumbled queso fresco. I know my recipe isn\u2019t authentic and I\u2019m not even going to attempt an \u201cauthentic\u201d version\u2026I\u2019m leaving that to the pros, like my new friend in Playa. :) I do like how the texture of this recipe is very similar and reminiscent of the meal I had last spring. If you\u2019re looking for a great new/different app to bring to your next social gathering or you want a quick, easy and delicious meal just for yourself, I think these cachapas will hit the spot! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Cachapas Serves 6 to 8

VThis week EXPRESS asked us to host a cookie decorating party as part of an event to launch their holiday collection. We went to town and bought a million different kinds of sanding sugars, dragees, jimmies, and luster dusts. We had the best time meeting and decorating cookies with the other ladies at the event. We thought it would be really fun to share with you our sugar cookie recipe and some tips and tricks so you can host your own cookie decorating party! Because we were throwing this cookie party to celebrate EXPRESS and their new holiday collection, we thought it would be cute to have fashion cookies. So we got a bunch of cookie cutters in the shape of t shirts, high heels, dresses, and skirts. We pre-flooded everything so that by the time the party started people could get straight down to the fun part, which is decorating. It was so cool to see how creative people got with the decorations on their cookies. We also made really cute take home bags so people could travel with their newly decorated cookies. The bags may look fancy, but they are so easy to make! All we did was run some white kraft paper goodie bags through our printer and printed out some circle labels. If you want to get really crafty, we cut out a little paper ribbon our of paper we printed a pattern on to use for a little color and extra decoration. If you guys are thinking about throwing your own cookie decorating party, here are some quick and easy cookie decorating tips to help you guys get the best results! royal icing:  this particular icing can seem intimidating, but trust us, its totally not! The recipe we provided gives you a stiff icing, perfect for piping lines and creating detail work. -When working with royal icing, it\u2019s best to first divide your batch into small bowls and create all your desired colors (if you\u2019re using professional grade gel colors, begin using a tiny bit at a time and continue to add more and more as you need it. It\u2019s so concentrated that the nice shade of baby pink you were going for will suddenly be hot pink before you know it! I usually dip the end of a bamboo skewer into the gel colors and dab my icing and mix. I do this until I get the color I want\u2026little by little. -Once you\u2019ve loaded your piping bags and are ready to begin decorating, remember that you\u2019ll get a better result when your tip doesn\u2019t actually touch the surface of the cookie. You want to sort of \u2018air\u2019 drag the line of icing to create a border or any detailed work. -flooding cookies: once you\u2019ve created a border and it has fully dried, you are ready to add a small amount of water to your icing to loosen it and then pour it into the area you want filled. I like to use my finger to spread the icing around and a toothpick for smaller areas.  The icing must dry completely before you can begin decorating. -it\u2019s fun to paint the surface with luster dust and we used it like paint by dabbing a small amount onto a paint brush and painting it on dry as well as adding a small amount of alcohol to the luster dust to make it more concentrated/deeper colors\u2026just play around and have fun with it! -since we brought all the cookies pre-baked and flooded with plain black and white surfaces, we also created what we called our \u201cglue\u201d for the evening. It was a super loose royal icing (1/2 cup royal icing plus 2 1/2 tablespoons water) that we used by dabbing onto a paint brush and gently brushing onto the cookies to allow sprinkles and other decorations to properly stick to the surface. -patience is key here! I know that sucks, but you\u2019ll really achieve the best results if you wait for each application to dry before moving onto the next! (this is why cocktails (or nonalcoholic, but sparkly beverage) snacks and great company are always a good idea!

VHi Guys! I hope everyone had a great Halloween! Teri and I just got back from our quick trip to San Francisco and I spent my evening watching scary movies, tending to trick or treaters and carving pumpkins with my love. It was the perfect, quiet Halloween night! The boyfriend and I had our big Halloween hurrah last weekend with friends\u2026plus we may have also dressed up and dressed our dog up as the  Where\u2019s Waldo  family and gone to the local dog park, where volunteers held a fun (fundraising) festival for dogs fully equipped with boutique vendors, a food truck, silent auction, agility area, bake sale, photo booth, and costume contest. All I have to say is the Redondo Beach dog community is absolutely amazing and I\u2019m thrilled to be a part of it! I couldn\u2019t believe the amazing turnout! So many obsessed owners and their precious dogs came (most even dressed up!) and the event was a complete success! I\u2019m really hoping to become more involved next year by baking some homemade dog treats to donate to the event. I think that would be so fun! Anyway, totally switching gears from my \u2018I\u2019m a crazy dog lady\u2019 story to today\u2019s recipe\u2026we have these yummy Salted Dulce De Leche Bars! They\u2019re super easy to make and so very rich and decadent. It\u2019s the sort of recipe that could possibly send you into a sugar coma; that\u2019s where the salt comes it. Not only does the salt balance the sweetness in the recipe, I love a hint salt when baking with oats as well as creamy dulce de leche. I finished the bars with chopped butterscotch chips\u2026 why chopped? Chopping the chips allows for the butterscotch flavor to come through in the bars without the added hard \u201cchip\u201d texture, which I think is a little too much. These have really been my go to dessert lately, to bring to parties, meetings, etc. They\u2019re super quick and easy and such a crowd pleaser! I highly recommend making these salted dulce de leche bars, even if it\u2019s just to satisfy your own sweet tooth! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Salted Dulce de Leche Bars Makes 1 (8\u201dx 8\u201d) pan

VAnyway, totally switching gears from my \u2018I\u2019m a crazy dog lady\u2019 story to today\u2019s recipe\u2026we have these yummy Salted Dulce De Leche Bars!
p18547
aVNot only does the salt balance the sweetness in the recipe, I love a hint salt when baking with oats as well as creamy dulce de leche.
p18548
aVI finished the bars with chopped butterscotch chips\u2026 why chopped?
p18549
aVChopping the chips allows for the butterscotch flavor to come through in the bars without the added hard \u201cchip\u201d texture, which I think is a little too much.
p18550
aVI highly recommend making these salted dulce de leche bars, even if it\u2019s just to satisfy your own sweet tooth!

VI just spent a huge wad of cash on the internet buying epic cover everything spf 1000 sun screen and rash guards with built in sun protection. I am going to Hawaii for Thanksgiving! So excited to hang out with my family and soak up with sun (which means sitting in the shade). I am a really pale human. I realized this when one time I went to the Bahamas and got a sun burn so bad that I was peeling everywhere. It was so gross. I had a picture of myself on facebook from it, and it was by far the most commented picture of my facebook. Why? Because all my friends commented with remarks like \u201cyou\u2019re so tan!\u201d I have since deleted the photo because I was in a swimsuit and I don\u2019t want to have facebook pictures of myself in a swimsuit. Needless to say in preparation for winter swimsuit situations, I have been trying to eat well. So when we made this Black Pepper and Lemon Asiago Dip it was really hard to be good and not eat all of it. I had like 10 bites. Still good, because there was quite a bit left. This is one of those go to cheesy delicious easy dips. We paired it with sweet potato chips, which are very delicious, but I think it would be amazing with celery sticks or carrots. Yummy! \u2665 Teri Black Pepper and Lemon Asiago Dip Makes about 1 cup

VHi Guys! Thank you all so much for your much needed feedback about my nerdy fogging sitch, your responses were all so helpful and very appreciated!! Anyway, lets get right into this tasty spicy chocolate sheet cake. I love chocolate cake. The end. Just kidding\u2026although I do love me some chocolate cake. It\u2019s something I find that I don\u2019t eat often at all\u2026maybe once or twice a year if a birthday rolls around, but if I\u2019m in a situation where chocolate cake is involved I will almost never say no. Today\u2019s chocolate cake is just a little bit special. From the outside it might appear to be a basic chocolate cake, but once you dig into it you taste the layers of smooth chocolate, with deep earth notes from the stout and with hints of spices from the Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. It\u2019s nice because if you can\u2019t handle a lot of \u201cspicy\u201d you\u2019ll still be able to handle these\u2026it just adds an extra \u201csomething\u201d to the cake. Why a sheet cake?\u2026because sometimes all a girl has time for is a sheet cake. :) The peanut butter frosting might push this over the edge just a little bit, but it\u2019s holiday season so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s totally okay. Maybe this could be that fun and unique dessert you\u2019re looking for to dress your thanksgiving table?! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Spicy Chocolate Stout Cake with a Simple Peanut Butter Buttercream Makes 1 (9\u201dx13\u201d) sheet cake

VThere is something to be said about warm dip. I prefer it over salsas and guacamole for sure. Probably because warm dip almost guarantees there will be some sort of dairy product in it, most likely of the cheese variety. A long while ago we made an  Artichoke and Roasted Garlic dip , one of my favorite things to make of all time in the world of dips. So delicious. I am happy that we are now giving you another warm dip recipe, this time a Hot Crab Dip. The thing about this crab dip is that it is LOADED with crab, like as much crab as we could possibly fit into this recipe without it just being crab. My other favorite parts are the corn, which gives this dip a nice texture, and the bell pepper. All delicious and live together so nicely when baked and smeared on a warm toasted crostini. We made this for recipe for all your people that watch the Super Bowl. I will be watching that one live stream that has kittens and puppies running around a mini football field because that is much more my speed. Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Hot Crab Dip Serves 6 to 8

VI love a good winter appetizer, and this recipe we have today fits the bill. These little dudes are our Cheesy Apple Farro Cakes. I ate a lot of these for dinner after we made them with some roasted root veg (because roasting veg is my new obsession), and it was delicious. They remind me a little of our  Cheesy Quinoa Cakes  we posted awhile back., so comforting and yummy, and really perfect for the change in weather. As you can see from the process photos, these savory faro cakes are really easy to make. I really appreciate it when I can make a dish with only one prep bowl. Dishes just are not my thing. We made this recipe for  McCormicks recipe program Go4Gourmet . They gave us three ingredients (apples, nutmeg, farro, chestnuts) to use in the creation of our recipe. The Cheesy Apple Farro Cakes were a perfect fit for us appetizer-loving people, but you can always put these on top of a healthy salad or with another side and have them for dinner.

VThis Sunday my boyfriend and I will be running in our very first 5k. I\u2019m so scared\u2026.like petrified. We moved into a new apartment a couple months ago, which happens to be right next to the beach. When we moved we promised each other and ourselves that we would try our hardest to not take living by the water for granted and that we would make the most of beach living. I guess it has sort of become our suedo \u201cresolution\u201d for the year\u2026.so far, so good! Something we\u2019ve taken up due to the move are beach runs. It\u2019s honestly something I NEVER thought I would be doing. I like a good yoga and spin class a few times a month and have even dabbled in a little barre, but running\u2026noooo thank you. I\u2019ve tried going for runs in the past and it\u2019s always ended up the same\u2026I get dressed, get my \u2018pump up\u2019 playlist set up, fill up a bottle of ice water for when I return, then somehow 2 hours later I\u2019m still at home avoiding the run and then it never happens. I\u2019m such a lazy procrastinator sometimes! Anyway, I have no idea why, but this time around things are different. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re both so committed and we\u2019re doing it together, but it seems to have gotten easier to actually push myself out the door and get my legs moving. It\u2019s totally weird and kind of freaking me out, but I also sort of love it. So back to this Sunday, yep we\u2019re running our first 5k together the morning of Super Bowl and we\u2019re both really excited with a very healthy side of terrified. I know for many people 3.1 miles doesn\u2019t seem like much at all, but I\u2019m totally not one of those people. Not to mention, about a month after the Super Bowl run, my sister and I will be participating in a 10k together up in Santa Barbara (both our alma mater). I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in way over my head, but I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll survive both runs\u2026although the jury\u2019s still out\u2026.like what if I trip on my shoelace and fall over? or what if I somehow get lost? (I know in a sea of 10,000 runners, this might seem difficult\u2026I\u2019m just sayin\u2019) OR the worst\u2026 what if I straight up have a meltdown during the middle of the run?! Helpful tips and suggestions from anyone who has participated in this kind of stuff is very, very welcome and appreciated!! Something that\u2019s keeping me a little more motivated about the run this Sunday and having to get up early, is that fact that I\u2019ll be making these pickled pulled pork sandwiches. Plus the timing couldn\u2019t be better; I\u2019ll be able to set the pork shoulder up in the morning before we head out the door and by the time we\u2019re home and everyone\u2019s ready to eat the shoulder will be totally melt in your mouth soft and ready to shred and serve. This is actually the only dish I make in a slow cooker (specifically our multifunction  Cuisinart 3-in-1 Cook Central ). I never grew up eating slow cooker meals, simply because slow cookers are just not something my family used. This though in my opinion is the perfect slow cooker dish because it\u2019s so easy and mindless to throw together with mouthwatering and \u2018punch you in the face\u2019 flavorful results\u2026.and now I\u2019m thinking I might dabble around with this slow cooker a little more. Maybe tomato braised oxtails?! We shall see. Any tips for this slow cooker novice is also very much appreciated! :) If you\u2019re looking for a super delicious yet easy Super Bowl dish\u2026here you go! Don\u2019t want to make sandwiches?\u2026no problem, turn them into tacos!

VWelcome back from the weekend! I am still trying to get into the swing of things from the holidays. Sometimes it\u2019s just really hard to jump back into concentration and productivity. Today we have a pretty simple recipe for Polenta Fries. These little sticks are cut from a slab of polenta and then lightly fried. This recipe is pretty versatile, you can serve them as a side dish to something delicious and meaty, appetizers, or our favorite, as party food! With Super Bowl coming up soon these would be perfect. We served ours with sides of our  marinara sauce  and a simple tarragon aioli. I love the texture of the polenta, and I prefer to give them a real good pan fry, the crispier the better, just how I like my In and Out French fries well done. Enjoy and happy Monday! \u2665 Teri Polenta Fries Serves 6 to 8

VLately I\u2019ve been craving spicy, comfort foods and for me Korean fried chicken is definitely one of them. Korean fried chicken is something my sister and I grew up with. My mom never made it (she\u2019s not a big fan of frying or fried foods), but every now and then we would go to the Korean market with my mom and she would get us an order of honey and peanut (which by the way, peanuts need to be crushed and sprinkled onto a lot more savory stuff) glazed Korean fried chicken in the prepared foods section and we would happily nosh on the package together because it was a big pile of sweet, sticky, crispy, rich, deliciousness. Even if it was slightly soggy from steaming in the package on the way home, we didn\u2019t care, it was just that good to us. I\u2019m not sure why this random childhood food memory of eating fried chicken is so clear in both our minds. Maybe it\u2019s because during the peak of our \u201ccat-fighting stage\u201d of sisterhood we were able to set whatever adolescent issue we had with one another aside and enjoy a casual meal together with a lot of parent gossip and laughs. Those times growing up were my absolute favorite. Today we have a similar version of this nostalgic meal but in nugget form\u2026.yep, Korean Chicken Nuggets, and with a spicy Korean bbq sauce. These are easy to pop in your mouth bone/hassle free and although the sauce is quite spicy, the drizzle of honey helps to balance the heat and the black sesame seeds add a nice nutty flavor and crunch. (OR you can substitute crushed peanuts, which are also delicious) I know frying can be a pain in the butt at times, but when the right occasion calls for it, these are totally worth the extra work. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Korean Fried Chicken Serves 5 to 7

p19048
aV1. Preheat oil to 350°F.\u000a
p19049
aV2. For the spicy Korean bbq sauce: Place all ingredients into a bowl and whisk together until fully incorporated. Set aside.\u000a
p19050
aV3. Sift together the flour and cornstarch into a mixing bowl. Whisk in water until fully incorporated and no lumps remain.\u000a
p19051
aV4. Dip each nugget piece into the batter and shake to remove any excess. Carefully drop each battered nugget into the hot oil and fry for 5 to 6 minutes (this will have to be done in batches).\u000a
p19052
aV5. Drain onto paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Once all nuggets have been fried, place nuggets back into the fryer and fry a second time (double fry) for 5 to 7 minutes or until light golden brown and crispy. Lightly season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p19053
aV6. Using a pastry brush, paint each nugget with a small amount of the spicy bbq sauce, garnish with black sesame seeds and finish with a drizzle of honey.\u000a
p19054
aV**You can pour the sauce into a bowl, thin it out with a small amount of water, add the nuggets and toss together to coat them quickly, before transferring onto a serving dish with a slotted spoon and garnishing\u000a

VLately I\u2019ve been craving spicy, comfort foods and for me Korean fried chicken is definitely one of them.
p19057
aVMy mom never made it (she\u2019s not a big fan of frying or fried foods), but every now and then we would go to the Korean market with my mom and she would get us an order of honey and peanut (which by the way, peanuts need to be crushed and sprinkled onto a lot more savory stuff) glazed Korean fried chicken in the prepared foods section and we would happily nosh on the package together because it was a big pile of sweet, sticky, crispy, rich, deliciousness.
p19058
aVToday we have a similar version of this nostalgic meal but in nugget form\u2026.yep, Korean Chicken Nuggets, and with a spicy Korean bbq sauce.
p19059
aVThese are easy to pop in your mouth bone/hassle free and although the sauce is quite spicy, the drizzle of honey helps to balance the heat and the black sesame seeds add a nice nutty flavor and crunch.
p19060
aVI\u2019m not sure why this random childhood food memory of eating fried chicken is so clear in both our minds.

VGood Morning America  asked us to create some perfectly easy recipes to celebrate the Oscars. You all know we love making cute little appetizers so obviously we were so excited. For our menu we decided on a simple yet elegant cocktail, an herbed deviled egg, and a really yummy salted caramel and chocolate tart! All of these recipes are really simple and easy to throw together. We also think our  Black Pepper and Lemon Asiago Dip  would be great if you\u2019re in the mood for a dip. You may also want to try  Korean Style Cocktail Meatballs , which is a personal favorite. We also have a couple of really quick and easy tips to decorate your Oscar Party. The first one is edible gold. I know we have mentioned this before but you can add a little bit of edible gold to anything, like we did with our Salted Caramel and Chocolate Tarts, and it will automatically take it up a notch. We found ours at an Asian market, but you can easily order it online after a quick google search. For our Oscar party decorations, we used a combination of tissue paper garlands, as well as garlands we made out of gold tinsel pom poms. The gold tinsel pom poms are inexpensive and really easy to make into a garland. We used a regular needle and thread, and half inch and one inch tinsel pom poms. You could also use the tinsel pom poms glued to the top of skewers to make really festive swizzle sticks for your drinks! They\u2019re so versatile! An easy way to dress up plain paper plates is to use edible gold spray paint. You can tape off part of the plate and spray only a corner for a nice pop of color. You can also lay parchment paper over the area of the plate you wish to block off. A large re-closeable plastic bag also works, just place the plate inside with a corner left out and spray away! We don\u2019t know about all of you but we are so excited to check out everyone\u2019s dresses. That\u2019s the best part right? What are you guys planning for the Oscars?

VAlright, so this is a Carrie Bradshaw recipe. I\u2019ve finally been watching Sex and the City. I\u2019m a little late, I know, but I really like the show. That is until Carrie becomes a spoiled brat and ruins everything she has with Aiden. She is such a 5 year old. It makes me mad. You and me both know she never ever cooks! She doesn\u2019t want to get food on her ugly designer shoes! So this is what I call a Carrie Bradshaw recipe because its so easy, even a dingus like Carrie can make it. I sincerely hope that after finishing ALL of Sex and the City, and then watching the movies, that my respect for Carrie will begin to flourish as opposed to dwindle. Please tell me I am right. \u2665 Teri Grilled Corn Salsa Serves 4 to 6

VRemember how we made  blackberry jam  about a month ago? Well I still have a ton of it. I love making jam and eating it, but I always find that I always make more than I know what to do with. These super \u201csemi-homemadeish\u201d pastries are a great way to use up all the homemade jam you might have laying around from the summer. So we have made Blackberry Jam Straws & Blackberry Stuffed Cinnamon Rolls. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious you can make your own cinnamon rolls from scratch. I wasn\u2019t feeling so ambitious so I bought some; I\u2019m usually not a fan of the canned cinnamon roll dough, but I kind of like them with sweet berry jam swirled in them. I\u2019m not going to lie, the cinnamon rolls can get a bit messy when unrolling, stuffing, and re-rolling, but it\u2019s so easy it\u2019s worth it. You can totally skip the homemade icing and use the stuff that comes with the cans, but I just prefer to make my own because it takes two minutes and tastes much better, me thinks. Enjoy and have a great weekend! xx Jenny Jam Straws Makes 16 Blackberry Jam Stuffed Cinnamon Rolls Makes 16

VHi Everyone! I hope you all had a great holiday weekend and that travelling wasn\u2019t too hectic for anyone. I just flew back from Chicago, after spending a whole week at home with my family and I\u2019m still craving my mom\u2019s home cooking. Whenever I\u2019m in the mood for a little taste of home, I tend to make this simple dish. My mom normally makes this dish with leftover kimchi and pork belly stew, but I\u2019ve made mine vegetarian (with the exception of the egg) this time around and with regular kimchi from the fridge. If you want this dish to be more hearty, by all means add some thinly sliced pork belly, it\u2019s really good! The kimchi adds a nice unique and spicy flavor to the fried rice and its something that can be eaten by itself and still be nice and filling. This dish is also super simple to make and if you\u2019re someone who regularly has kimchi in your fridge, you most likely already have the other ingredients lying around as well. If you don\u2019t have kimchi (with 7 boxes of baking soda surrounding it) in your fridge everyday like me, then the nearest Korean market is your best bet to find the stuff and for the best quality. If kimchi is something you\u2019re never tried then I urge you to go out and give this amazing Korean super food, filled with antioxidants, a shot! Enjoy! xx Jenny Kimchi Fried Rice Serves 3 to 5

VHello! So do you all know the world famous Sarah Park, aka my mom?\u2026You don\u2019t? Hm, that\u2019s weird. She\u2019s the best Korean food cook in the WHOLE WORLD. Yep. I said it and I truly, 100% mean it. If anyone tries to challenge me on this one\u2026\u2026.. lets not even go there, bc it would most likely begin with a lot of aggressive name calling, in broken-Korean, and end with some sort of Dance Dance Revolution contest and well\u2026..that\u2019s just severely awkward. Anyways, I know \u201cmom/dad\u2019s cooking\u201d is a very personal thing to many people and I just love that! I mean I\u2019m definitely someone who credits my passion for food and cooking to my parents, who were shoving things like fish heads, tiny fermented shrimp and hot pots down my throat from a very early age. How is it that moms can whip the same dish together using different ingredients each time or swap this for that and so on; yet the dishes always seem to taste the exact same?\u2026totally awesome and perfect! I\u2019m amazed sometimes at how my mom\u2019s mind works in the kitchen. She\u2019ll start making something like kimchi\u2026realize halfway through she doesn\u2019t have rice flour to thicken her kimchi paste/sauce and without even flinching she\u2019ll grab a potato, boil it, grind it and stir it in as her starchy thickening agent. Pure brilliance, me thinks. No, it\u2019s not rocket science, just wonderful mom hands at work, putting love and care into every single dish :) This recipe is one of those dishes that my mom will tweak here and there depending what she\u2019s got in the pantry and it\u2019s one of my absolute favorites and great to eat year round. I do want to give a bit of warning because this dish is  spicy.  It\u2019s the kind of spicy that doesn\u2019t hit you right away, but then 5 minutes later you feel your face burning up and you\u2019re wiping the sweat off your nose. You can definitely lessen the \u201cspicy\u201d by adding a small amount of honey to the mixture. The cucumbers and egg also serve as a \u201cmouth cooler downer\u201d. Oh and guess what?? This recipe is GLUTEN-FREE (if you use tamari instead of soy sauce). Take away the egg and boom. It\u2019s VEGAN too! Didn\u2019t think us bacon loving ladies had it in us did ya?! Enjoy! xx Jenny Note: I\u2019ve actually never ever participated in any form of Dance Dance Revolution, so there!\u2026not ALL Asians do it. I am a terrible driver though, so there\u2019s that :) Bibim Nengmyun (Buckwheat Noodles Tossed with a Hot Pepper Sauce) Serves 2-3

VHey, guess what? My pants are feeling kinda tight. In a \u201cI\u2019m a total fatty kinda way.\u201d Why can\u2019t bread and cheese be good for you? Why do we live in a world where things like bok choy and brown rice can be eaten by the bowl full and its ok? Why can\u2019t I eat cheeseburgers for every meal and have it be ok? Seriously, it makes me mad. It makes me mad that I\u2019m not totally in love with things like brown rice, but I am totally in love with things like pork. Its like being the girl with the perpetually horrible boyfriend. Why would I want to be eating a salad when I could be eating french fries? I dunno. How do you guys do it? Is there like a mind trick? Maybe if I close my eyes and plug my nose spinach will taste like nachos. Maybe I should eat all my meals after taking the  miracle fruit  and maybe then spinach would  really  taste like nachos. That would be rad. Anyway\u2026 This Cherry Tomato and Thyme Tart is the stuff lunch is made of. For me anyway. There are tomatoes on it, so that to me, would count as basically eating a salad. I know, I\u2019m a horrible unhealthy eater. So shoot me. \u2665 Teri Cherry Tomato and Fresh Thyme Tart Makes 1 tart

VCan I tell you guys a little secret? I have a weird obsession with scones. I mean, I like eating them, but I LOVE making them! There is so much you can do with a scone. You can make them savory or sweet, enjoy them with a hot coffee or tea, slather them with homemade curd or jam or a delicious herb butter and so on and so on.They\u2019re also SO easy to make, it\u2019s seriously about 10-15 minutes of prep and about 25 minutes of baking. Easy-Peesy. I developed this particular scone recipe a few months ago because I needed to make a small something to bring to a brunch I was attending the next day.I took my basic sweet scone recipe, scaled down the sugar and and added a few of my favorite savory ingredients that I ALWAYS have on hand; bacon (duh), Gruyere (my favorite hard cheese) and green onions (it\u2019s kind of a Korean thing). All I can say is that 20 minutes after I arrived to the brunch my scones were gone and 4 people were asking me for a recipe. I just don\u2019t see how one can go wrong with salty, buttery, cheesy goodness?! I will definitely be making this for many more brunches to come and then some :) xx, Jenny Bacon, Gruyere & Green Onion Scones Makes 12  3 inch rounds

VFirst, I would like to let you know that from now till December 22nd you can get 20% off your next Gilt Taste purchase by entering the promo code spoonforkbacon when you check out. So think about those last minute holiday gifts. In other news, I bought my cat a bow tie I am really excited about. I am also in the market for new photo props, so if any of you know awesome places to buy plates and things please tell me! I would very much appreciate it. I pretty much hate eating salads. I never crave them. I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend to be some healthy person who eats salads all the time because I \u201clike\u201d them, or eat sliced tomatoes or celery as a snack. Get real. I do understand that my diet can\u2019t just consist of meat and bread and pork and potatoes and goldfish crackers. I do I get it. But salads, unless they have bacon and a butt load of bleu cheese, I\u2019m just not that into it. This salad is different. It actually tastes good. Other salads, while granted are leafy greens ones, kinda taste like I\u2019m eating grass from my front lawn where the feral cats hang out. This salad is rad because it has so much texture and crunch. So if you\u2019re a salad hater like me, you should try this. I feel like its a good jumping off point to eating salads for every meal like all the girls here in LA do. \u2665 Teri Light and Fresh Wheat Berry Salad Serves 3 to 4

VChicken Fried Potatoes. These are glorious. Crispy on the outside thin potato slices and a French fry in the middle. So that\u2019s pretty awesome right? We also made a homemade buttermilk ranch dipping sauce. This is one of my favorite appetizers we have posted recently because it\u2019s really simple to make, not a whole lot of ingredients, and its totally delicious. Once you have your assembly line down for the coating of the potato slices everything else is a cinch. It\u2019s really easy to make batches and batches of these. You all know these would be perfect for Super Bowl, but I think these would be perfect for lots of situations, like as a side dish to our  50/50 burger , or just as a meal on it\u2019s own (cause you\u2019re an adult and you can do what you want), or as a delicious snack. Lot\u2019s and lots of ways for this recipe to be enjoyed, so get to it! \u2665 Teri Chicken Fried Potatoes Serves 6 to 8

VHi all! Today we have a really fresh and simple Kale Salad with blood oranges. I love to cook; that\u2019s really no secret, but sometimes I come home exhausted from work and I don\u2019t want to cook, nor do I feel like going out. The results? I usually end up noshing on cheese and crackers or break romaine leaves apart and dip them in dressing. Sad, I know. Even more depressing, lately I\u2019ve been trying to be \u201chealthy\u201d and well, it sucks. The other day I broke out my new (as of Christmas) Vitamix and tried my hand at home juicing. The juice was actually pretty awesome and I didn\u2019t mind the slightly pulpy texture due to no pulp extractor like in an actual juicer. I took more time to prep and clean then I had hoped which sucked, especially since it was a super busy day for me. I\u2019ve been eating a lot of wheatberry, kale and quinoa just trying to mix things up all the time and keep me from getting bored. This Blood Orange & Kale Salad is actually one that\u2019s been on my regular rotation of \u201chealthy meals\u201d and it\u2019s one of my faves! It\u2019s super easy to put together (I\u2019ll usually make this salad and vinaigrette in the morning before work, in two separate containers, so when I come home it\u2019s just pour, cover and shake. It\u2019s so filling and flavorful that I actually don\u2019t crave hot dogs and doughnuts 20 minutes after I\u2019m finishing eating, like most salad make me feel. This salad is seriously awesome anytime. Go try it! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Simple Blood Orange and Kale Salad with a White Balsamic Vinaigrette Serves 3 to 4

VCan we just talk for a second about how much I am looking forward to the Hunger Games movie? I feel embarrassed by it. Like admitting I am totally obsessed with Twilight (I\u2019m not. Ok I am kinda am, ugh). WHY do I like all these movies? Is it a series thing? Star wars, Love. Harry Potter, I watch parts of movies at least once a week. Twilight, less so, I went through a phase with that. Why do I feel like people judge me because I love all that crap? Are you secretly judging me? Its ok if you are. I will try not to judge you for judging me. :) Do you ever wish there was like an Eternal Sunshine erase your memory pill you could buy at CVS so you could watch Star Wars and Harry Potter like it was your first time ever? I think about that a lot, and think about how awesome that would be. Please tell me some of you feel the same way as me! Ok. Chicken Flautas. These make the perfect lunch AND make really good left overs. They are almost as good as cold pizza. I envision these are the perfect after school or after work snack. I hope you will think so too. These Quick & Easy Baked Chicken Flautas are so good! \u2665 Teri Quick & Easy Baked Chicken Flautas Makes 6

VHi Hi Hi! Yay! Our first ever crafty how to whatever you want to call it. I\u2019m really excited for it! Watercolor Easter Eggs. Pretty right?!?! AND really really easy. I will show you. Here we go. This is what you need: Dye + plastic spoons. I used this  dye , but I\u2019m sure food coloring would work just fine.  You need vinegar, and water to prep your eggs, and a baking sheet, or metal tin to collect the run off dye. The secret to these is to make a dark color version of dye, and then a lighter. I just added 50% more water to the existing color to make a lighter version. First prep your eggs. Get a bowl, mix 50% water and 50% vinegar and wipe the eggs down with the mixture. Dry em. Then grab you spill collector. Start with the lighter colors. Its all about layering dark to light. Hold the egg over the tin on both ends, and simply pour some color over it. After you have made your pour, turn the egg in your hand so the color goes all the way around. You MUST let the color completely dry in between the pours. I used a blow dryer to speed things up. Once your egg is dry, repeat with another light color, or a darker one. This part is where you can get crazy. You can do a lot of pours, or a little. *See that little white plastic circle in #2? Thats a water bottle cap. It makes a great holder to dry your egg on. ** I didn\u2019t wear latex gloves in the picture, but you probably should. :) BOOM. Super pretty, really easy, Watercolor Easter Eggs. Yay.I Really hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I did, and I hope you all find time this weekend to crank out some awesome Easter eggs! To compliment our Easter eggs, we wanted to do a prettier version of an egg salad sandwich. Lets be real, egg salad isn\u2019t the prettiest thing ever. So we decided to deconstruct it a bit. The result is a super pretty, super simple sandwich. Aren\u2019t the eggs so pretty and graphic?!? This seems like the perfect post Easter egg hunt lunch to me! \u2665 Teri Egg \u201cSalad\u201d Sandwich Makes 2

VHi All! So today is a sad day. Today Teri, her boyfriend and I begin a juice cleanse (notice how my boyfriend is not involved\u2026smart guy). Yep, it\u2019s true\u2026and I\u2019m SO nervous about it! Am I going to starve? Am I going to turn into a huge bitch for a few days? Will I be sprinting to the bathroom all day?!?! All these things have me really worried, but I guess I also see this as a little adventure\u2026.a hungry, sad adventure, ha! Why do it then? Eh, worth a shot. Why not! :) I know, it\u2019s a little ironic that the same day we go on a major cleanse we post the most unhealthy, decadent, creamy thing we can think of\u2026.but it\u2019s just sort of wishful thinking, I guess. This is seriously one of my favorite pasta dishes\u2026EVER. It\u2019s SO good. Plus, this pasta seriously takes 15 minutes to throw together and you need a handful of ingredients! Please go put on your fat pants and make this dish. I definitely plan on doing so after this cleansing is all said and done. Does that defeat the purpose?..eh well :) Enjoy! xx Jenny Basic Pasta Carbonara Serves 2 to 3

VI\u2019m having a hard time with the weather. It has been super nice here in LA. This means, t shirts, dresses, and shorts. I\u2019m more of a over sized sweater, boots, and a scarf (at all times!) type of person. So switching gears is something that I don\u2019t do well. I can\u2019t get rid of my scarf. Its like my security blanket. I just can\u2019t. This year though, I am going to try and wear normal person spring/summer shoes. Maybe more dresses instead of pants. The scarf situation, is one that I just can\u2019t give up. I have decided that I am going to find light beach scarves, and wear those. It is the issue I have with warm weather clothes as I have with food. I don\u2019t want to eat spa salads, sprouts, and other light stuff in spring and summer. I want my pasta and chowders. If you\u2019re like me, and holding onto the last bit of winter, lets all eat some ziti together and wear scarves. \u2665 Teri Baked Ziti Serves 6 to 8

VHi All! Hope everyone\u2019s having a great week! Last week I talked about the need to \u201cdetox\u201d after a few days of indulging in \u201cawesome, but not so great for you\u201d foods. Today I have anther one of those no fuss, tasty \u201cdetox\u201d dishes. I love beets in all ways. I will eat them raw, roasted, steamed, pureed into a soup\u2026.I LOVE beets! Not only is this salad healthy and delicious, but it\u2019s super pretty too, right?? Also, the light and tangy vinaigrette pairs quite nicely with the assortment of veggies in this dish! If you\u2019re having a hard time finding black beets or red celery (which has only been around a couple of years), you can swap them out for more common, easy to find varieties. If you like beets, but the thought of eating them raw doesn\u2019t sound appealing to you, you can always slice them into 1/4 inch rounds, toss them in some oil, salt and pepper and grill them for a few minutes on each side. So good! Also, farmers markets everywhere in the states should be in full effect by now, so have a little fun with this dish and go pick up some great seasonal vegetables of your choice and toss them into the mix! If you haven\u2019t been making the best food decisions lately, guess what? It\u2019s totally okay\u2026so long as you squeeze dishes like this into your weekly rotation every now and then. That\u2019s what I think at least :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Shaved Beetroot Salad with a Sweet Champagne Vinaigrette Serves 4 to 5

VHave you guys ever seen the movie Fried Green Tomatoes? I used to watch that movie over and over again when I discovered it as a teen. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it kind of helped shaped my personality. Idgie Threadgood, one of the main characters doesn\u2019t take crap from anybody. She is one of those characters you love because she is so stubborn, and does what she wants. Maybe she is kind of mean but its ok, because you love her anyway. I wanted to be that kind of person. Not a push over, tough, yet caring. I would hope that my friends today would describe me as such. Anyway, if you have not seen this movie you really should. Every time I think of a tomato I think of the movie. So here we give you Baked Tomatoes. No, they are not green, and not fried, but they are really pretty and make an awesome side dish. \u2665 Teri Herb and Panko Crusted Baked Tomatoes Makes 8

VI am really excited for the new Wes Anderson movie. People I have mentioned this to, in general, seem far less enthused than me. I don\u2019t get it. The cinematography, the set designs, the costumes. It all fits together so perfectly. I can\u2019t wait. There is this very very short clip in the trailer where two kids are dancing to music. For some reason, that clip is so perfect to me, I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. If you have not seen the trailer yet, you can see it  here.  It\u2019s smoothie time. Smoothies are kind of this awesome thing I forget about because my blender sucked so I gave it away. Frozen fruit is the whole reason smoothies are great. You can make a smoothie from stuff in your freezer. Its so easy and awesome! This Blueberry & Banana Buttermilk Smoothie has a bit of cinnamon in it, which really changes things up. I would love to know if you all make smoothies on the regular, and if so, what are your fav flavor combos. \u2665 Teri Blueberry & Banana Buttermilk Smoothie Makes 3 cups

VPanzenella Salad is for salad haters. It\u2019s like the best possible case scenario for a salad. This year for my birthday, Jenny made me dinner. She had talked to me about side dishes, and then brought up the word \u201csalad\u201d and asked what kind I liked best. \u201cMeh, I don\u2019t like salad.\u201d I said, and this is how I learned of Panzanella Salad. The thing with salads is that to me, they will never be as face melting as pork belly sliders or poutine. So why should I waste stomach space on it? I know, I know, I should because it\u2019s good for you. I know. I agree. Still doesn\u2019t mean I like it, or am happy about eating it. I am happy about eating sandwiches, and since Panzanella Salad is basically a salad made of a sandwich, I think it\u2019s the best salad ever. \u2665 Teri Simple Panzanella Salad Serves 5 to 7

p20407
aV4. Pour mixture onto a baking sheet, in single layer (you may need two baking sheets) and bake for about 20 minutes, stirring every 5 to 7 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown. (It\u2019s okay if the croutons are still slightly soft when you pull them from the oven, they\u2019ll crisp up eve more once cooled).\u000a
p20408
aV5. Set aside and allow croutons to cool completely.\u000a
p20409
aV6. In a large mixing bowl combine croutons, mozzarella, tomatoes, and cucumber and toss together. Set aside.\u000a
p20410
aV7. For the vinaigrette: Place shallot, garlic, brown sugar, and balsamic in a small bowl and whisk together. While whisking add oil, in a slow and steady drizzle, until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p20411
aV8. About 30 minutes before you\u2019re ready to serve, pour vinaigrette over salad and toss together until well coated.\u000a
p20412
aV9. Place in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\u000a

VHi All! Today we have beef satay for you! I love the potent flavors of lemongrass, ginger and lime, within most Thai style satays. If you\u2019re able to find kaffir limes and/or kaffir lime leaves use those to replace the lime zest/juice used in this recipe! Kaffir limes are sweeter and more mild than regular limes and the leaves are the best part! They\u2019re filled with this lovely citrus flavor which I may or may not have dabbed on my wrists one or two times to use are a perfume bc I love the smell so much (I\u2019m a creep, I know). Traditionally, beef satay is made with thin slices of beef, threaded onto a skewer and grilled, but we\u2019ve changed things up a bit by using a NY strip steak and cutting the pieces of meat into cubes. The cubes just make for \u201cmeatier\u201d (no pun intended) and more filling bites\u2026and we totally like  meaty and more filling  over here. ;) These make great appetizers at a party or a great entree for a quiet night in. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the laundry list of ingredients! Most of the marinade and peanut sauce ingredients are repeats of one another and most of this recipe itself calls for throwing everything into a blender and blending away. So the next time you have guests over, why not treat them to some really yummy and easy to make, beef satay! xx Jenny Beef Satay Serves 3 to 4

VIt\u2019s really awesome when two great things come together into one. For instance, R2D2 and C3PO, Harry Potter and magic, bread and butter, and corn and spoon bread. So, I give you: jalapeño cheddar spoon bread! This recipe is corn bread in a souffle pudding texture situation. Ok, i know what you\u2019re thinking. Why would I choose jalapeno cheddar spoon bread over regular corn bread? Well, let me tell you. 1. You can make spoon bread mountains or volcanoes on your dinner plate. (If you were a cool kid, you used to make these with mashed potatoes and peas. ). 2.  This makes an incredible base at the bottom of a bowl of chili. 3. You get to eat it with a spoon. 4. The texture feels like silk deliciousness in your mouth. A couple scoops of this saucy corn heaven will breath new life into any traditional country fare. Eating fried chicken? Tried adding a couple scoops of this magic sauceplex. I hope you love it! \u2665 Teri Jalapeno-Cheddar Spoon Bread Serves 5 to 7

aV6/2/2012 UPDATE: Some people have had issues with the amount of spoon bread they\u2019re getting using a 9\u2033 x 12\u2033 baking dish. It\u2019s totally okay that the spoon bread doesn\u2019t rise very much while baking and is only about an inch thick\u2026BUT if you want a thicker spoon bread here\u2019s a quick fix: Either increase the recipe by 1/2 OR switch to a 8\u2033 x 8\u2033 baking dish!\u000a

VLets talk about summer, and swimming. When I was kid I would go swim for hours and hours, and then order some awesome fried food and a sandwich from the snack shack. It was great. Pool food was always better when eaten after a good swim. If you ate pool food before swimming it was a mistake. First it would not taste as good, at all. I\u2019m pretty sure being covered in pool water made things taste better. Second, if you ate pool food before you swam, you would have to wait like 45 minutes before going into the pool. That waiting game is horrible for a kid. I would usually get one of two things, a grilled cheese, or a steak sandwich, both with curly fries (because who are we kidding, curly fries are the best kind of fries ever.) So when Jenny made this sandwich, the first thing that came to my mind was pool time. This last weekend in LA it was gross and muggy and hot. Prime time pool time for sure. I advise bringing this steak sandwich to your next pool outing and digging in after a big swim. I hope you guys like this, my favorite part is the hard boiled egg, it really makes it! \u2665 Teri Chivito: Uruguayan Steak Sandwich Makes 1

VSometimes you have a bad day. Sometimes you have lots of bad days in a row. Then you have a good day, and its exciting and fun. That is what has just happened to me. I was starting to feel like there was a bit of a dark cloud following me around (only there wasn\u2019t because its been 90 degrees L ) the last few weeks. I just have not been super excited about stuff. Then, BAM, the things I were overthinking and having anxiety about figured themselves out, and I got the air conditioner to stop making that funny and super annoying noise. ALSO! Jenny and I are both really excited about our book coming out next Tuesday. You can see some recipes and pictures  here . YAY! WE ARE REALLY EXCITED OMG! Ok. Anyway, White Cheddar and Black Pepper Scones. Sometimes to get through the dark times, you need to shake things up and make savory scones. Sometimes you need to drink tea in the morning instead of coffee, sometimes you need to go workout until your butt is sore, and then eat 3 White Cheddar & Black Pepper Scones with butter. Sometimes you have to do it. Get to it! \u2665 Teri White Cheddar & Black Pepper Scones Makes 16

VI got locked in my closet last night. Don\u2019t ask me how. Ok, I will tell you know. See, I have one of those funny ha ha boyfriends. A boyfriend who plays pranks and does hilarious things all the time. One of them being walking into the closet while I am in there looking for something, forcing his way into my teeny closet with me, closing the door, and declaring its \u201cseven minutes in heaven!\u201d Did I find this amusing? No. I was in the middle of something, doing complicated work stuff. I reached for the door handle and gave it a good twist. Nothing. \u201cHuh.\u201d I thought. Tried it a few more times, nothing. We got locked in. As I tried to turn the knob again and again, the knob came off in my hand. Trying to stick the knob back in the hole just pushes the handle from the other side out more. I knew if we lost that handle, we would be screwed. I ended up unscrewing the screws on the handle hardware with a pocketknife I had in my closet (again, don\u2019t ask). This whole process took about 30 minutes, complete with panicked text messages to Jenny and Adrianna, an awkward phone call to my neighbor that ended up being a long babbling nonsensical embarrassing voicemail, and tears of laughter. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t have to call the fire department. That story has absolutely nothing to do with baked polenta, so I won\u2019t even try to make some random connection. I do really love all the things in this recipe though. Polenta, goat cheese, Italian sausage, and cremini mushrooms. All together this will make for pretty darn good side dish to a lovely salad. Go for it. \u2665 Teri Baked Polenta Serves 5 to 7

VHi Guys! We\u2019re  reluctantly  happily continuing our healthy eating/living with another light and refreshing recipe! We have a seared ahi tuna dish that sits over a bed of mixed greens with lightly sauteed beech mushrooms and a ginger-miso dressing. I love seared ahi and wanted to try something a little different by mixing sesame seeds with almond meal. I loved the flavor the almonds added to the tuna, but I missed some of the crunch from the usual fully sesame seed coated steaks, so I switched the almond meal out for the medium ground almonds to get some of that crunchy texture back. The beech mushrooms add a nice hearty and earthiness to the overall dish. If you\u2019re not a fan on beech mushrooms or can\u2019t find them, feel free to use whatever mushrooms meet your fancy. This is such a fantastic dish because it can be thrown together in 10 or 15 minutes, and it\u2019s really filling. Great when you\u2019re short on time. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Black Sesame & Almond Crusted Ahi Tuna Serves 2

aVI loved the flavor the almonds added to the tuna, but I missed some of the crunch from the usual fully sesame seed coated steaks, so I switched the almond meal out for the medium ground almonds to get some of that crunchy texture back.

VHi Guys! Everyone seems to be jumping into the Thanksgiving spirit and we totally are as well. We\u2019re starting today with these crazy looking sweet potatoes. We have a really simple mashed sweet potato recipe for you today, using purple sweet potatoes, only because I found some at the market the other day and I love the intensity of the purple! If you can\u2019t find purple sweet potatoes or the color of them freak you out non-purple sweet potatoes work just fine. :) I\u2019m not a huge candied yam person so to me this is the perfect, slightly sweet alternative. Not so in your face sugar which is how I like it. As we all prepare for this upcoming time of reflection and thanks I think it\u2019s important to remember our loved ones back east, the devastation that has hit them and what we can do to do our part and help. Whether it\u2019s donating money, food, clothes, etc. every little bit counts. During this time, lets not forget about all our furry friends who also lost their homes, were separated from their families and have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on. They desperately need our love and compassion during this difficult time. You can donate for both people and animals through a large number of different organizations both established and created for this specific cause. I hope everyone has a wonderful and safe week! xx, Jenny Mashed Purple Sweet Potatoes Serves 4 to 6

VHi Guys! It\u2019s the day before thanksgiving and I\u2019m sure everyone has their menus planned already. We have thanksgiving in Chicago, at my parents house, every year. It\u2019s kind of funny because when I tell people we have two full thanksgiving dinners, I don\u2019t just mean we eat turkey etc. and then nibble on the same thing a couple hours later, but we really have two whole separate meals. For the most part we have a traditional thanksgiving dinner with the usually suspects, turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing, veggie sides, etc; that\u2019s dinner number one. About an hour after our turkey/ham dinner has settled in our stomachs (but not really because we tend to eat like gluttons) we have Korean dumpling soup, multiple banchans (Korean side dishes), multiple types of kimchi, a sushi platter, and a sashimi platter. About an hour after THAT we have dessert, usually consisting of multiple pies and a fruit platter. Is this strange? I used to say it was an asian thing, but I soon realized that not all my asian friends partake in the double meal ritual\u2026..so maybe it\u2019s just a Park family thing? Does anyone else have some not so traditional thanksgiving traditions? Whether food related or not? Anyway, back to the food we actually have up today! BEER BREAD\u2026.and not just any beer bread\u2026.BLACK PEPPER, PARMESAN BEER BREAD. This is the easiest bread you\u2019ll ever make\u2026no need to wait for rises. You mix everything up, dump it into a loaf pan and bake! When Teri tried it the other week I think she gave the perfect description, \u201cIt\u2019s very hearty, but airy\u201d. I totally agree, this bread is actually rather dense, but when you take a bite it\u2019s not heavy like you would expect. So if you\u2019re in a pinch for a last minute bread recipe OR if you want a nice loaf of bread to make leftover turkey sandwiches with, like  this one , I recommend this simple and delicious beauty! If you\u2019re not into black pepper or parmesan you can omit them all together or add whatever mix-in flavors you prefer! I hope everyone has an amazing thanksgiving, filled with laughter, loved ones, good food, and plenty of booze and  mocktails ! xx, Jenny Black Pepper and Parmesan Beer Bread Makes 1 (9\u201dx5\u201d loaf)

VI had never really messed around in the kitchen with clams until last year when I started becoming obsessed with paella. Now, I am pretty into them, and this recipe we have for you today is like a delicious clam dream. First lets talk about when a clam made me scream. I didn\u2019t know this, obviously because I am naive concerning clams, but they can move in their little shells. I was preparing my seafood for my paella and scrubbing the shells of my clams. Some of clams had little bits of seaweed sticking out the seams. I decided it would be a good idea to just pull the little bit of seaweed out. Instead what happened, is  my little shell friend  pulled the seaweed back into its clam, and there by shifting it\u2019s weight in the shell, and there by seriously freaking me out. I dropped the little guy into the sink and screamed and ran. This, is sad. I feel stupid screaming, I feel stupid not knowing. When things move in your hands you don\u2019t think should move it is scary, so at least give me that. Now that I have told you my story, hopefully you newbies with clams will be aware of the fact that these things can happen. I leave you with Coconut & Green Curry Steamed Clams. \u2665 Teri Coconut & Green Curry Steamed Clams Serves 2 to 3

VHey Guys! Today we have this really great salad for you. This salad is very easy to throw together and the name pretty much speaks for itself\u2026it\u2019s awesome and really wonderful anytime of the year (plus, I couldn\u2019t think of a better name!). I love the bitterness of radicchio, especially paired with a sweet and tangy balsamic vinaigrette. The ingredients in this salad are pretty much based on my own personal preferences. It has both the earthiness of the beets and mixed greens and the hearty texture of the chickpeas which I think beings good balance to this salad overall\u2026.but feel free to swap out ingredients you don\u2019t like for ones you do! What I think makes this salad super special is the ricotta salata, a cheese I learned about just a year ago and am now seeing pop up even at regular grocery stores! It\u2019s basically a dry ricotta\u2026.think feta/cotija hybrid, Italian style. It\u2019s SO good and really makes the salad pop! Some of you might be a bit surprised at the amount of oil added to the vinaigrette. Nothing bums me out more than a vinaigrette that taste like  nothing but oil, with a hint of balsamic\u2026.so this recipe definitely packs a punch. If you prefer a more mild vinaigrette, then go ahead and add in another 1/4 cup\u2026eat it however you like! As the weather begins to get chilly here and everyone is getting into the spirit of hearty, comfort dishes; remember this salad as a great alternative to those stick to your ribs meals. Oh and did you guys see our gorgeous  Candied Yam Pie  yesterday? Wasn\u2019t it puuuurtty?! Holiday desserts are always so much fun, and we\u2019re going to keep it going with another pumpkin pie alternative at the end of this week so we hope you\u2019re ready. Yay! Have a great week! xx, Jenny The Awesome Anytime Salad Serves 3 to 4

p21142
aV**To roast the beet: Preheat oven to 375°F. Rinse any dirt off the beet and thoroughly dry. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over the beet, wrap in foil and place directly on the rack in the oven. Roast for about 40 minutes or until tender. Allow beet to cool before unwrapping, peeled and dicing.\u000a

VI love the bitterness of radicchio, especially paired with a sweet and tangy balsamic vinaigrette.
p21145
aVIt has both the earthiness of the beets and mixed greens and the hearty texture of the chickpeas which I think beings good balance to this salad overall\u2026.but feel free to swap out ingredients you don\u2019t like for ones you do!
p21146
aVWhat I think makes this salad super special is the ricotta salata, a cheese I learned about just a year ago and am now seeing pop up even at regular grocery stores!
p21147
aVNothing bums me out more than a vinaigrette that taste like  nothing but oil, with a hint of balsamic\u2026.so this recipe definitely packs a punch.
p21148
aVAs the weather begins to get chilly here and everyone is getting into the spirit of hearty, comfort dishes; remember this salad as a great alternative to those stick to your ribs meals.

VHi Guys! Growing up I hated the taste of anything black licorice\u2026.like REALLY hated. I think it all started when my family and I were walking out of a restaurant that offered those candies in the front that look like teensy, misshaped m&m\u2019s, but that are actually candy coated sunflower seeds, sometimes flavored with black licorice. I eagerly spooned a big pile into my hand, leaned my head back, opened wide, and down my piehole they went. One minute later I was coughing up and choking on seeds, candy coating and the powerful taste of black licorice\u2026.NOT teeny-tiny m&m\u2019s. Now, when you\u2019re expecting smooth, creamy milk chocolate and you unexpectedly get a giant mouthful of licorice\u2026.major vom. Anyway, that experience pretty much scarred me for life and I had kept away from black licorice-like things ever since\u2026.that is until I attended culinary school. We were working with fennel one day, which I had already deemed as foul, grossy-grossness. My chef knew about my aversion to licorice/anise like things and introduced me to grilled fennel, finished with a star anise gastrique\u2026so pretty much a heaping mouthful of stuff I didn\u2019t like\u2026licorice on licorice, great. I took one bite and my mind was blown. I didn\u2019t need the giant glass of water I had prepped for when I would presumably begin to choke! I actually LOVED it! Grilling the fennel brought out the natural sweetness and adding an acid to the anise sauce really softened the intense flavor. These days I love all things with the flavor of anise/black licorice\u2026except the candy. I still cant handle that stuff, but I do love cooking/baking with star anise and well as eating fennel in a variety of ways. My favorite way is still grilling them, which is what we have for you today! Grilled fennel tarts! These little guys are so simple and really delicious. The cheese and herb spread on the bottom has just enough richness to cut through the strong fennel flavor, but doesn\u2019t overbear it. They\u2019re great appetizers for get-togethers, but what I really like doing is pairing the tarts with a simple mixed greens salad and enjoying it as a light meal. I hope everyone has a great weekend\u2026perhaps making and eating some grilled fennel tarts?! :) Enjoy! xx, Jenny Grilled Fennel Tarts Serves 4 to 6

VHi Guys! We have more biscuits for you today because it\u2019s Monday and I need something really awesome to keep me going this week. I love sweet potatoes\u2026.everything about them. I love their creamy texture, with the hints of natural sweetness they carry\u2026so good. I love cooking with them, but more so I love love love baking with them. When you bake with potatoes it\u2019s like adding instant moisture to whatever it is you\u2019re making. We made  these guys  a little while back and they\u2019re one of my favorite kinds of doughnuts\u2026.with the cutest name, Spudnut! Super cute, right? Not only does baking with sweet potato add a smooth texture and tons of moisture, but they also add a gorgeous orange tinge to whatever it is you\u2019re making as well. Anyways, back to these Sweet Potato & Rosemary Biscuits. I love them. Really.

VHi Guys! Lets get right to food\u2026today we have this gorgeous strawberry-rosemary tarte tatin! The end\u2026.just kidding, sort of. This dessert really speaks for itself. Pretty.Tasty.Easy. The perfect dessert. I love desserts like this because they seem really impressive, but are actually super easy to throw together and require minimal ingredients\u2026.plus, who doesn\u2019t like sweet, warm fruit paired with a light and buttery crust for dessert, right?? This dessert is great anytime, but I really love making this if I\u2019m having friends over during the week. I barely have anytime to brush my own hair during the week, let alone cook a feast for friends, but when I do invite people over for dinner during the week, this dessert is a life saver. I don\u2019t have to prep anything out ahead of time (although I usually like cutting up the strawberries a few hours before, so they\u2019re ready to go) and I can whip this up from the time dishes are being brought to the kitchen and until people are ready for a night cap. You can also use other fruit like bananas or peaches, I used strawberries because they\u2019ve been really cheap at the markets lately and I love adding a touch of rosemary to desserts, when appropriate, for that small boost of fragrance and flavor. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this super easy and delicious tarte tatin. xx, Jenny Strawberry & Rosemary Tarte Tatin Serves 6 to 8

VHi guys! We\u2019ve had a weird spike in temp out here in LA and we\u2019re up to about 80 degrees F! This calls for an early spring celebration\u2026.grill radicchio. Grilled vegetables in general\u2026.so yum. I love grilling vegetables because t\u2019s so easy and the results are always good\u2026always. You get this natural smokey flavor from grilling your veg and with a light brush of some melted butter and balsamic?! Whoa so good. Sorry, just having a grilled veggie moment. :) Anyway, this radicchio me loves! I love the bitterness of radicchio, the great crunch it gives and the slightest bit of sweetness that tends to linger in your mouth, especially when grilled/charred. The grilling also softens the overall bitter flavor for those of you not so into those flavor notes. The balsamic drizzle is like radicchio\u2019s soulmate. So good. You don\u2019t have to add the honey by any means; the balsamic will thicken and sweeten up quite nicely on its own, but I like adding a touch of honey every now and then because it adds a \u201cbarely there, but glad it\u2019s there\u201d type of taste where the reduced balsamic doesn\u2019t seem as molasses-like. I know the grilling might be a little for some of you out there, but it\u2019s fun to think that spring is right around the corner!

VThere are two kinds of people, people who turn red when they are embarrassed, and people that do not. I can feel the blood travel from torso into my face when I am embarrassed enough to turn red, and I know it is happening. There is nothing I can do about it, and it sucks. The thing about turning red is you can\u2019t just act cool and that what just happened wasn\u2019t embarrassing because everyone knows you are embarrassed. Your face is red. Yesterday at the gym I had a face turning red incident. Like a lot of people, I have an iPhone Velcro sleeve thing that makes me look like a power ranger and a playlist aptly titled \u201cwork out\u201d that contains a bunch of songs that help try and get into doing cardio.  While in the locker room sliding my iPhone into my armband thing, the music started playing really loud, and it was a monstrously inappropriate rap song. So so so inappropriate. I tried to swiftly make the music stop but of course my iPhone chose that moment to have a meltdown and so it took an extra couple of seconds to get it to stop. I could feel the heat of the all the naked women in the locker room staring at me questioning my offensive taste in music. Horrible. My face was so red, there was just no way I could play it cool. I ended up just staring at the floor, mumbling sorry, and getting out of there. Ugh. Anyway\u2026 So we all know it\u2019s flu season and people are getting sick left and right. We wanted to share a new sick soup with you. This egg drop soup is for people who are getting sick of chicken noodle, it could also be for people who just want a really cozy soup to eat while they watch this crazy storm brewing outside their windows. I hope everyone stays safe, and uses this as an excuse to make lots of yummy food. \u2665 Teri Egg Drop Soup with Rice Cakes Serves 4

VFirst, as some of you may know our blog was nominated for  Savuer Best Food Blogs of 2013  in the category of Best Cooking Blog. What an unexpected and great surprise for us. If you have not already, you should go to Saveur and  vote  for your favorite blogs. There are tons of categories and a lot of great people nominated. :) I went through this strange phase in college where for a long period of time, longer than I am willing to admit, I ate candied carrots, and nothing else\u2026 Except Dr. Pepper. I had a poor diet, but for some reason I was really really into candied carrots. After candied carrots, it was sliced tomatoes with salt. It was one of those weird phases in my life where I think I was subcoinciously trying to see if one could survive on nothing but carrots and Dr. Pepper. The answer is that you can, but your skin will probably turn a weird color. That is what happened when I OD\u2019ed on carrots. Anyway, so obiviously being a big fan of carrots I love this dish. So this great little simple dish is the perfect side for nearly anything, and it\u2019s so pretty! \u2665 Teri Balsamic Grilled Baby Carrots Serves 3 to 4

VDid everyone have a good weekend? This weekend was the first time I was able to have a full two days off of work and it was glorious. I\u2019ve been on shoots nonstop for the past  4 weeks and I was just about ready to crash. Thankful I was able to sit back and relax this weekend\u2026 plus the boyfriend was in Vegas so this pretty much means I laid around in bed all weekend with my Dexter. We went to the dog park, took plenty of daytime naps together and he ran a couple errands with me. It was the perfect weekend. Since I did so much laying around, I didn\u2019t get much of anything productive accomplished. I think the most productive thing I did was make myself this Lobster & Corn Pasta. Yes, I had a \u2018dinner for one\u2019 kind of night on Saturday and I decided it was time for me to treat myself. Rarely do I ever cook fancy meals when it\u2019s just me; I\u2019m lucky if I can convince myself to prepare more than just a box of crackers and some cheese for myself when I eat alone. This weekend was different. This weekend was all about me and that meant cooking myself a fancy meal. I\u2019m usually not the biggest lobster fan. Like I don\u2019t really get a craving for it, but last weekend I wanted lobster and I wanted pasta, so I did a 2 in 1 sort of thing. I learned to combine lobster, corn and tarragon together in the first restaurant I worked in (and p.s. best combo ever\u2026the sweetness of the lobster and corn against the bright and powerful anise flavor of tarragon\u2026so good!) I was in charge of prepping our ravioli and it was the most delicious combination of lobster, mascarpone, corn, pimentos, and tarragon. I probably ate that dish every shift I worked. Heaven\u2026except for my poor waistline. Anyway, this pasta is sort of a tribute to that magical ravioli dish. I usually wouldn\u2019t think of pairing this sort of mature sauce with such a playful pasta like fusilli, but I love just much how of the sauce is absorbed by the ridges of the fusilli! You get a burst of creamy, delicious sauce in every single corkscrew, it\u2019s great. I think this is definitely the perfect pasta to make when you want to treat a loved one to something special, or when you\u2019re just in the mood to \u2018treat yoself\u2019! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Lobster and Corn Pasta Tossed in a White Wine and Tarragon Cream Sauce Serves 2

VI am really excited to present to you this great free form Potatoes Au Gratin. I would like to think of myself as a potato aficionado (It\u2019s the Idaho in me!). Whenever I am at breakfast and the side choices are salad and potatoes, it\u2019s potatoes. Obviously. No question. Eating a sandwich? Put potato chips on it! Getting a burger? French fries on the side, or inside for that matter. Potatoes Au Gratin bring back a lot of memories for me. I used to work at this French restaurant in college, we had these amazing creamy Potatoes Au Gratin, and we would run out on busy days on occasion and people would have meltdowns because the only other thing I could offer them is a side salad. I got it, I understood, you come to a restaurant expecting to have a delicious side of Potatoes Au Gratin and instead get offered a salad. I always felt horrible. I remember asking one of the chefs the secret to their Au Gratin, and it was to make sure you let the potatoes sit in the cream for a long time. This allows the starchiness of the potato to exude and really marry into the cream. Our recipe calls for 5 minutes if you happen to be short on time, and because our slices are thin. If you have the time you can make slightly thicker slices and really let them soak up that cream. I love the concept of the free form because I think it just looks so beautiful and organic. Plus, the crunchy sides I believe are the best part. We are serving ours with a béarnaise sauce because it just really makes this dish such a treat, and I for one love the added richness. Enjoy! \u2665 Teri Free Form Potatoes Au Gratin with Béarnaise Sauce Serves 5 to 6

aV1. Preheat oven to 375°F.\u000a

aV2. Place sliced potatoes into a mixing bowl and top with cream. Toss gently to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Allow potatoes to sit for 5 minutes, or longer if you can.\u000a
p21758
aV3. Line a baking sheet (with a lip) with parchment and begin placing the potatoes in a single layer, slightly overlapping one another. Sprinkle the surface with some shallots, garlic and cheese. Dot the surface with a small amount of butter and lightly season with salt and pepper.\u000a
p21759
aV4. Continue layering potatoes and shallot mixture until all the potatoes have been used, placing small dots of butter between each layer.\u000a
p21760
aV5. Top gratin with remaining butter and season bake for 15 about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Place back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender and the cheese has bubbled and browned on top. Allow gratin to cool for 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve with béarnaise sauce.\u000a
p21761
aV6. Béarnaise sauce: Place 2 teaspoons tarragon, vinegar and shallot into a small saucepan and reduce by half. Strain and set aside until completely cooled.\u000a
p21762
aV7. Place egg yolks and vinegar reduction into a stainless steel or heatproof glass bowl and whisk together until the mixture doubles in volume. Place mixture over a pot with simmering water (make sure the water from the pot does not reach the bottom of your bowl) and begin whisking. While whisking, begin to add melted butter, in a slow and steady stream, until fully incorporated and the béarnaise is thick and smooth. (the sauce should gradually thicken as you add the butter) Remove from heat and add remaining tarragon and season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.\u000a

VYou know when you\u2019re a kid and people would always tell you that you\u2019ll understand and appreciate your parents much more when we\u2019re older? Well people (including my own parents) always told me that and I really hated hearing it. It was during a time in my life when my adolescent self thought I knew everything there was to know in the world and my mom was my mortal enemy. I was convinced it was her sole purpose in life to ruin mine. I mean how dare she \u201cforce\u201d me to do after school activities and \u201cforce\u201d me to go to Korean language class every SATURDAY morning\u2026.didn\u2019t she know I had a very important (13 year old\u2019s) social life?! Ugh, if I didn\u2019t like doing something why wouldn\u2019t she just let me quit after a day? Really mom, no sleepovers unless it\u2019s a special occasion? WHO ARE YOU?! It\u2019s a funny thing, this growing business. I graduated high school thinking I can\u2019t WAIT to get away from here (and HER); then I got to college, my mom helped me settle into my dorm, flew home, and I was forced to be somewhat independent. Suddenly all I wanted to do was see my mom, talk to her, get her advice, etc. Once I had settled into college life it\u2019s like all that \u201cunderstanding and appreciation\u201d talk came true. I started thanking my lucky stars that I had a mom who always encouraged me to try new things\u2026ice skating? Sure! basketball? Yes, honey! Clay sculpting class? Of course! As long as my sister and I were being productive, she was all for it. How cool. Even today, I kick myself and hate that I didn\u2019t pay better attention during Korean school and that my Korean speaking and understanding abilities are sadly nowhere near where they should be. Today, I don\u2019t think I can get through the week without daily phone chats with mom about how her grand-pup is doing and just pretty much shooting the shit. Never did I think in a million years that my mom would be someone I respect most in the world and one of my best friends (not in the creepy, she\u2019s trying to act too young for her age type of way). :) She\u2019s such a big part of my overall support system and I love her everyday for it. My mom\u2019s a bit of a health nut and she loves vegetables and simples flavors, so today I have a dish dedicated to my mama. Simple roasted radishes. Easy, fresh, clean flavors. If you\u2019ve never roasted or cooked with radishes, imagine something similar to a turnip. It\u2019s pretty mild and once roasted the slight bitter taste goes away and produces a subtle sweetness. I hope everyone has a great Mother\u2019s Day this weekend celebrating all the amazing mama\u2019s out there! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Roasted Radishes Serves 3 to 4

VHey Guys! Today we have another great picnic sandwich for you, Bocadillo Bites! Bocadillo are Spanish style sandwiches served on a crusty baguette. They\u2019re usually pretty basic sandwiches that can be filled with anything from omelets to cold cuts to sweets. I had this particular type of Bocadillo in Spain years ago although I think the peppers were different. I remember looking at the sandwich with lack luster thoughts, wishing I had some mustard and mayonnaise to slather between layers of what seemed to be a dry and sad looking sandwich. I was so wrong and pleasantly surprised! The uber simple sandwich was delicious, full of flavor and perfectly filling. For something so simple it was perfectly balanced. I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu of one of my favorite, local (Southbay) restaurants, Abigaile. If you like Manhattan Beach Post I highly recommend Abigaile. The food is wonderful; from their hamachi sashimi to their roasted bone marrow, and even bocadillo bites. :) I also love that they brew their own craft beer and serve super delicious scratch cocktails. When I ordered the bocadillo bites it took me right back to a hot August afternoon in Barcelona, at the beach with my family playing games and munching on this tasty treat. Our version is super simple and doesn\u2019t really require a proper recipe, but we\u2019ve given you one anyway just as a reference. This sandwich packs up and holds extremely well, making it perfect for picnics or on the go lunches. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Bocadillo Bites Serves 5 to 7

VHi Guys! I hope everyone had a great thanksgiving! I\u2019m sure everyone is stuffed and fridges are loaded up with leftovers. Last year we suggested you all make these with your leftover sweet potatoes or yams and this year we have the most simple and delicious after turkey day snack\u2026.using your leftover mashed potatoes (these will also work if you have mashed sweet potatoes)\u2026they\u2019re mashed potato chips! Okay, so they\u2019re duchess potatoes (with a fun little name), but really what\u2019s better than a little bite of star shaped potatoes that are crisp on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside? Not too much. So if you\u2019re looking for something quick and easy to do with those leftover mashed spuds sitting in the fridge\u2026.maybe some mashed potato chips are calling your name. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Mashed Potato Chips (aka Duchess potatoes) Serves 4 to 6

VAs an adult I love mushrooms. As a child, I hated them. I think that parents who claim their kid is a picky eater are maybe feeding them things that are gross. Case in point, I hated mushrooms. So gross. Ew. Yuck. That is because the only mushrooms I had ever come into contact with were button mushrooms. Button mushrooms in my opinion, taste like weeds and dirt. I think they are the worst of the mushroom options. So knowing this, as an adult, I wasn\u2019t super optimistic about trying different kinds of mushrooms. When I finally did, it was a life changer. Now I love mushrooms (the right kinds) on everything, and in everything. I always buy crazy mushrooms at the farmers market, and this is the perfect dish to utilize them. This is a super quick and easy perfect for dinner pasta dish. Rigatoni with a wild mushroom crema sauce. I\u2019m excited about it, and I can\u2019t wait to make it again!

VJenny and I are jetting off on a quick little business / pleasure trip next week and I could not be more excited to have a tiny little break. I need one pretty bad because little things are starting to set me off. Like when my landlord comes and blocks the entire driveway to everyone that lives here instead of pulling up into an empty parking spot to water the \u2018front lawn\u2019 which is really dirt. Or when you\u2019re at the vet and the crazy lady next to you asks what is wrong with your cat, and you tell her, and she responds with \u201cmaybe it\u2019s just time to let go, you know?\u201d At that moment in time I could only picture myself as Grumpy Cat and the word NO floating above my head in all caps while my expression says everything. So me being a grumpy cat these days, all I want to do is watch Nashville on TV and eat snacks. Lucky for me (and you) we have this fall inspired Savory Pumpkin Hummus. I really love hummus situations because it\u2019s so easy make. This one with pumpkin is my new favorite. The pumpkin is such a nice departure from your typical hummus flavor and I really love the flavor of this savory hummus with the garlic and cinnamon. So satisfying! Excuse me while I pig out on my new found love of Savory Pumpkin Hummus and try to de-grumpify myself. Bye! \u2665 Teri Savory Pumpkin Hummus Serves 4 to 6

VI have a new found love in veggies because of roasting. Getting a really nice crispy skin on some root veg really lets the flavor of the veggies come through. It makes steaming veggies seem so gross now to me. I actually don\u2019t think I will ever steam veggies again. So after roasting lots of veggies lately, it\u2019s fun to mix things up. Today we have these Thyme Roasted Parsnips and Apples. Apples are something I hadn\u2019t originally thought of adding into my roasting repertoire, but it\u2019s such a nice addition. It adds such a lovely sweetness to this dish. I am also kinda in love with the colors of this dish. Aren\u2019t they amazing?! Check out below for a giveaway with  SweeTango Apples! \u2665 Teri Thyme Roasted Apples and Parsnips Serves 4 to 6 We have a little giveaway for you today thanks to the fine folks over at  SweeTango.

VHi Guys! We hope you guys are enjoying our very first spread! We\u2019re both so excited about the new series and hope this spread is helpful for those of you in need of ideas for Thanksgiving or just in general! Today we have our first new recipe, which happens to be a Citrus and Herb Roasted Turkey! This brine recipe is pretty simple, but I really love it. It makes your turkey extra juicy and the aromatics (orange peel and herbs) leave a super light, subtle flavor. I love this because it really allows for the flavor of the turkey itself to stand out. If you want a more \u201cherbacious\u201d and citrus tasting bird, feel free to add more citrus peels and herbs to your brine. I\u2019ve also begun to not truss my turkeys as I feel it just creates more work and the results are pretty much the same. The only thing I do is fold the wing tips back so they don\u2019t burn. If you prefer the legs tied, by all means tie them up! No bigs. Oh and something I should mention is that everything in this weeks spread is cooked for real and is the actual recipe\u2026except this turkey. I faked this turkey, food stylist-style. I thought I should mention that incase people expect a perfectly browned bird. The brine is great and I stand by this recipe (I\u2019ve made it the last two years!), but the actual results will give you a pretty unevenly browned bird (especially because of the high temp you start with when you begin roasting the bird)\u2026still super delicious. I was just coming off of styling a bunch of turkeys for these target holiday commercials (which are just beginning to air on tv now, yay!)when we shot this spread and I couldn\u2019t resist faking just one more turkey. :)  Enjoy! xx, Jenny Citrus and Herb Roasted Turkey Serves 14 to 18

VDirections:\u000a
p22179
aV1. The night before thanksgiving, brine your turkey (for 8 to 12 hours).\u000a
p22180
aV2. For brine: Pour salt, sugar, peppercorns, coriander seeds, cloves, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, orange peels, apple cider, and vegetable stock into a large pot and simmer until salt and sugar dissolve, about 15 minutes. Allow mixture to sit until completely cooled. Stir mixture into ice water. If using brining bag, place turkey into bag and pour brine over turkey. Seal and place in refrigerator overnight. If using bucket, place turkey into bucket, breast side down, and pour brine over the bird. Place in refrigerator or a cold, dry place (if it doesn\u2019t fit in the refrigerator) overnight (adding 2 to 3 cups of ice to the mixture every 4 hours if turkey sits out overnight). Remove turkey from brine, pat dry and place onto the rack of a roasting pan. Discard brine.\u000a
p22181
aV3. Preheat oven to 450\u02daF.\u000a
p22182
aV4. Stuff cavity with stuffing or aromatics of choice (such as an apples, citrus, onions, herbs, cinnamon stick, etc).\u000a
p22183
aV5. Roast turkey for 30 minutes. Lower temperature to 350\u02daF and continue to roast for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until the thermometer reads 161\u02daF in the thickest part of the turkey\u2019s leg.\u000a
p22184
aV6. Remove from oven and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes (loosely tented until foil) before carving and serving.\u000a
p22185
aV**You can baste your turkey with melted butter or drippings every other hour if you desire.\u000a
p22186
aV**If your breast is beginning to dry out you can cover the breast tightly with foil and remove 30 minutes before the turkey is finished to crisp the skin.\u000a

VHi Guys! Okay, so I have sort of a random question for you and I\u2019m really hoping someone out there has an answer for me\u2026if you are a glasses wearer, how do you alleviate the fogging issue??? I\u2019m serious. I finally got glasses last week, after realizing driving at night was beginning to get a little dangerous. So now I wear these things on my face, most of the time, and the fog issue is out of control!! If you know me personally, you know that I\u2019m always hot or get hot very easily. I can be sitting in a room, doing absolutely nothing and I can feel my cheeks getting warm. Why? I have no idea! This was never a real problem until glasses happened to me. Now the second my cheeks get warm, major fog-age! Terrible! I know this is super nerdy, but I would really love any tips or advice anyone might have. I\u2019ve read things online about rubbing Vaseline onto your lenses, but that just seems weird and gross to me\u2026plus I\u2019m worried about ruining the \u2018fancy\u2019 coating that are apparently on my lenses. So if anyone could help me out with this lil\u2019 problem I would love you forever and ever and ever! Anyway, moving past my personal issues and onto today\u2019s recipe. We have a Sweet Potato and Rosemary Gratin! This gratin is easy, very easy. I used buttermilk instead of the usual milk or cream because I like the slight tang it adds to this dish. Just one little thing\u2026 please don\u2019t skip out on the broiling part at the end! The crispy crust that\u2019s created, up against the soft, savory interior? HEAVEN! And because sweet potatoes and rosemary were pretty much made for one another I threw a little of that in there as well. If you\u2019re looking to spice up your thanksgiving table, this quick and easy sweet potato and rosemary gratin might be worth trying out! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Sweet Potato and Rosemary Gratin Serves 6 to 8

V1. Preheat oven to 375\u02daF. Line a round 8\u201d cake pan with parchment paper and set aside.\u000a
p22239
aV2. Place sweet potatoes, buttermilk and 1 clove of minced garlic into a large mixing bowl and toss together. Allow mixture to sit for 30 minutes.\u000a
p22240
aV3. Line the bottom of the cake pan with a single layer of potato rounds. Some overlapping is okay.\u000a
p22241
aV4. Sprinkle the top with some garlic, rosemary and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper and continue layering gratin until all ingredients have been used.\u000a
p22242
aV5. Tightly cover with foil and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until fork tender. Remove foil and invert onto an oven safe dish. Sprinkle top with parmesan.\u000a
p22243
aV6. Turn oven onto broil and return gratin back to oven. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese is bubbling and top has crisped up.\u000a
p22244
aV7. Allow gratin to cool for at least 8 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\u000a
p22245
aV**Tips: You want to get rid of any excess liquid as you build the gratin (by shaking off each disc of potato), this will help keep the gratin together as you flip it over and un-mold. Also, make sure to un-mold gratin carefully and place directly into the oven (on an ovenproof plate) to caramelize, as the gratin will be rather loose when inverted and needs to caramelize a bit to hold together\u2026.the additional grated parmesan should help too! \u000a

VContinuing with our Traditional Thanksgiving Spread week, today we have an easy green bean side dish. These Lightly Roasted Green Beans are a really simple recipe which we love because we all know how complicated making Thanksgiving can be. As a kid, I never did eat very many vegetables (I was a total brat). I did however always love those green bean casseroles with the mushroom stuff and the onions on top. As I grew up though, I kind of lost my taste for the mushy green beans (I\u2019ll still eat em though!) in favor of cooked but still snappy green beans. So this recipe is perfect for that. Lightly roasted, and then topped with a parmesan almond crumble. Yum. I love the crunch that the almond gives this dish.  Stayed tuned because we have another side dish coming up this week that I am in love with! \u2665 Teri Lightly Roasted Green Beans (topped with a parmesan-almond crumble) Serves 10 to 14

VHi Guys! Thank you so much for all the wonderful advice for my run this Sunday\u2026we\u2019ll see how it goes! Our last new recipe before the big game (you know, the puppy bowl) is a wedge salad. Man, I really love these things. I know a lot of people turn their nose up to iceberg lettuce, but I love it. I love its crisp-juiciness\u2026is that a thing? Who knows. All I know is that I love iceberg and I love a good wedge salad. I also feel like if there\u2019s going to be any \u201csalad\u201d at all, sitting around on Sunday\u2026shouldn\u2019t it be one with salty, crispy prosciutto? that\u2019s also drowning in a gallon of rich and creamy bleu cheese dressing? Me thinks so. If you don\u2019t fancy a wedge salad, maybe delicious  Korean Fried Chicken Wings  are your thing? Or  Bee r Battered Fried Olives ? Or even  Kitchen Sink Chili ? Just a thought, that\u2019s all. Hope everyone has a great weekend\u2026.and let the best puppy win! xx, Jenny Quick and Easy Wedge Salad Serves 12

VHi Guys! Today we have our first new recipe in our \u201cNot So Traditional Thanksgiving Spread\u201d and we\u2019re replacing the typical thanksgiving centerpiece with a gorgeous Maple-Balsamic Roasted Duck and serving it with a simple, spiced cranberry and persimmon chutney. I\u2019m not going to lie, every year when thanksgiving dinner rolls around, I find myself with a plate loaded up with sides and a tiny sliver of turkey hanging off the corner. It\u2019s true. I like a nice juicy turkey, but with so many amazing side dishes being passed around the table, it\u2019s hard not to forget about the roasted turkey sometimes. Also, while I like turkey, I don\u2019t love it. I also think that it\u2019s difficult for a lot of people who aren\u2019t celebrating with dozens of people to rationalize preparing an entire turkey. I totally understand and that\u2019s why I think this roasted duck is the perfect thanksgiving turkey substitute. Think one duck won\u2019t be enough? No problem, just roast two of them! The cooking time will still be much less than if you were roasting an entire turkey. You\u2019ll end up with a juicy duck with a sweet, tangy and crispy skin. It\u2019s important to allow your duck to sit uncovered in the refrigerator overnight if you want the fat to render and the skin to crisp up. It\u2019s also important to remember that because so much fat will render from the skin, you want to make sure the layer of aromatics is thick enough to work as an organic \u201cwire\u201d rack so that the back side of the duck doesn\u2019t end up frying in its own fat. We hope you guys will stick around the rest of the week as we get through the rest of our new recipes in our \u201cnot so traditional thanksgiving spread\u201d! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Maple-Balsamic Roasted Duck with a Spiced Cranberry-Perssimon Chutney Serves 4 to 5

aV1. \u000a
p22450
aVFor chutney:\u000a
p22451
aV Place all ingredients into a medium pot and stir together. Place over medium high and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or until cranberries and persimmons become tender and begin to melt together. Set aside until ready to use. (re-warm when ready to serve)\u000a
p22452
aV2. 12 hours before roasting, place duck onto a clean plate and pierce skin all over with fork. Pat dry and place duck in the refrigerator, uncovered, to allow skin to dry.\u000a
p22453
aV3. Preheat oven to 375\u02daF.\u000a
p22454
aV4. Remove duck from refrigerator and fill cavity with aromatics (onions, tangerines, lemons, thyme). Tie legs together with twine and tuck winds behind back.\u000a
p22455
aV5. Arrange remaining aromatics in a roasting pan top with prepared duck. Generously season with salt and pepper and roast for about 30 minutes.\u000a
p22456
aV6. While duck begins to roast, whisk together all glaze ingredients.\u000a
p22457
aV7. Brush duck with glaze and continue to roast for about 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.\u000a
p22458
aV8. Once the internal temperature reaches 155\u02daF, raise the oven temperature up to 425\u02daF and finish roasting for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow duck to sit for about 10 minutes. Transfer onto a prepared platter and serve with chutney.\u000a
p22459
aV**Something to remember is that the skin will not have rendered as much as fat as when you just sear a breast, skin side down. To achieve the most crispy skinned bird, place duck under broiler for 2 to 4 minutes, turning as needed to prevent burning from the marinade.\u000a

VToday we have a beautiful stuffing recipe for you! This Apple Thyme Wild Rice Stuffing is my new favorite stuffing recipe. I absolutely love the look of this recipe, the red of the apple skins, and the black of the wild rice makes this dish absolutely gorgeous. Stuffing is one of my favorite Thanksgiving dishes. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a carb dish, and I have carb problems. I am also in love with the addition of apples. You may remember our simple recipe for  Thyme Roasted Apple and Parsnips , well ever since then I am really into roasting apples and using them in savory dishes. So the addition of apples in this stuffing is pretty awesome. If you\u2019re cooking Thanksgiving this year, I urge you to try this recipe, if you\u2019re not, then think about this dish for the near future! It is such a delicious winter dish! I will sadly not be eating Thanksgiving this year because I will be soaking up the sun in Hawaii eating seafood. I will however probably be making a mini feast when I return mostly so I can make  this sandwich. I am really excited about some of the other recipes we have coming up this week from our Not So Traditional Thanksgiving Spread so stay tuned! \u2665 Teri Apple-Thyme and Wild Rice Stuffing Serves 10 to 12 people

We have a few things in the works sucking up all our time at the moment, but can\u2019t wait to share them with you lovelies in the near and not so near future! Today we have a little something for a last minute, quick and easy v-day dessert. A simple sparkling sabayon! It\u2019s a great dessert for those of you planning on staying in Friday night, like my dude and I\u2026hello takeout and House of Cards marathon!! I love this dessert because it only requires three ingredients and literally takes no more than 10 minutes to make, start to finish. PLUS, you can just spoon this stuff into your mouth for a sweet, frothy, delightful treat or spoon some onto fresh fruit like we\u2019ve done today. The recipe actually results in a pretty thick, sit atop the fruit, froth, but since I let the mixture sit for a little while before we photographed it (whoops), some of the air in the Sabayon died. It\u2019s all good though because it has no effect on the taste and I usually like mixing it all up together anyway. We hope everyone has a great time celebrating or not celebrating V-Day and encourage you to try your hand at this totally easy and delicious dessert! Enjoy! xx, Jenny Sparkling Sabayon Serves 4 to 6

VPound cakes are my favorite. I think pound cakes are the easiest way to get a pretty looking dessert without getting too crazy, and by too crazy I mean frosting a three layer cake and making it look pretty. With pound cake, all you usually have to do is drizzle some glaze on top. That\u2019s easy, and so pretty! I love cakes that have drip situations. Obsessed. I have a collection of drip cake situations on my computer for inspiration. I think I love it so much because its just so pretty and impressive, but with not that much effort. So to continue our Traditional Thanksgiving Spread recipe week, we have this Meyer Lemon and Poppy Seed Pound Cake WITH a Citrus Vanilla Glaze. I love pies at Thanksgiving, but I would not argue when it comes to serving cake. This pound cake is easy to put together, so I would go for cake and pie if it were me. You have the time, yea? \u2665 Teri Meyer Lemon and Poppy Seed Pound Cake with a Citrus-Vanilla Glaze Makes 1 (10 inch) pound cake

VI woke up really early this morning to this weird recurring dream I keep having about whales. I don\u2019t do much other than count them from high above the water. I decided this morning that I would good what my dream meant. It turns out that having whales in your dreams means you are intuitive. They also said it could be because you are watching too much of that tv show Sea Shepard. Either way, I think this means that maybe someday I will use my intuitive senses to become psychic and be the hot girl version of Edward. Yes, that was a Twilight reference. Yes, I did watch Breaking Dawn part 1 yesterday, and it was pretty bad, but I still kinda like it. So there\u2019s that. Anyway, we have figs for you today. Figs are my very very very most favorite thing to make appetizers out of ever. The shape and color of them are perfect, and you cut them open and they are even more beautiful than the outside. I am always sad to see them go, so I try to eat as many as possible while they are in season. We have paired some grilled figs with a simple ricotta and hazelnut spread, then drizzled everything with honey. Honey and figs is like peanut butter and jelly, can\u2019t get any better. Go out and take advantage of fig season before it leaves guys! And make these Fig Hazelnut & Ricotta Crostinis! \u2665 Teri Fig Hazelnut and Ricotta Crostinis Serves 4 to 6

VThe BF John and I went to this super delicious noodle joint in Silverlake (LA) for dinner one night called  Watdongmoonlek Noodle . When we walked to our table we passed their dessert case there were a million desserts in their looking pretty begging me to eat them. We ate one, their seasonal dessert of Pumpkin Crème Brulee. Their Crème Brulee was made in little hollowed out mini pumpkins, and prepared so you could eat some pumpkin chunks while you eat your delicious custard. I was sold. I knew them we HAD to attempt to re make this for the blog. Welcome our version: No Bake Pumpkin Crème Brulee. How freaking cute are these little individual desserts? I was so pumped to have this be included in our Not So Traditional Thanksgiving spread, because these little guys are so cute and so unique. I am in love with them. Not only is crème brulee one of my all time favorite desserts, but so is pumpkin pie. So I am pretty excited about this, to say the least. As Thanksgiving draws closer, think about making these guys! NO BAKE! WHOA! We know you\u2019re short on oven space, so these just make such perfect sense. I hope you are as stoked as me. \u2665 Teri No Bake Pumpkin Crème Brulee Makes 8

VDirections:\u000a
p22843
aV1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a simmer. Add pumpkins (with lids), slightly lower heat and poach for 12 to 15 minutes or until pumpkins are tender but not mushy. Place pumpkins onto a baking sheet and place in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.\u000a

p22845
aVFor filling:\u000a
p22846
aV In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugars and salt. Add cream and eggs and whisk together until smooth. Set aside.\u000a
p22847
aV3. Pour milk, pumpkin puree and spices into a saucepan and whisk together. Simmer mixture for about 7 minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the pumpkin milk mixture into the yolk mixture, whisking while pouring to prevent the yolks from scrambling.\u000a
p22848
aV4. Once your mixture has been tempered, pour yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining pumpkin milk and whisk together. Continue to whisk mixture as it simmers to prevent scrambling and whisk until mixture begins to thicken, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla.\u000a
p22849
aV5. Divide mixture among poached pumpkins and refrigerate for about 2 hours or until custard sets.\u000a
p22850
aV6. Top each pumpkin filled custard with a layer of turbinado sugar and brulee tops with a torch. Serve.\u000a
p22851
aV**Tip: If mixture has scrambled a little, you can strain it with a sieve lined with cheesecloth top remove all the bits of cooked egg. If this happens, vanilla should be stirred in after mixture has been strained.\u000a

VHi Guys! So the most exciting thing is happening! I\u2019m moving!!! Okay, so I\u2019m staying in the city of Redondo Beach, but this time I\u2019m moving beachside! That\u2019s right, the boyfriend, Dexter and I are all moving next to the water and we\u2019re thrilled! While the boyfriend is excited to be in a 1 minute walking range from his favorite watering hole, Naja\u2019s place, and one of our favorite burger joints, the Standing Room, I\u2019m most excited to be in walking distance to the fresh seafood market at the pier, a whole foods market and my favorite local farmer\u2019s market! I can\u2019t wait to not have to hop in my car to run a few errands! I know this might seem like a small feat, but I look at being able to walk outside and arrive at your destination on foot (in a reasonable amount of time) a luxury\u2026especially living in LA! Anyway, with this crazy move happening during the holidays (terrible timing!) I feel like I barely have time to cook a proper meal. Something I\u2019ve been making big batches of lately, to help save myself on time, is this Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad. I\u2019ll make a batch of it on Monday and eat it multiple times a day through at least Wednesday. If I start to get bored with it I toss in some pepitas, pomegranate seeds or dried cranberries (dried and chopped cantaloupes are pretty amazing in this too!). I\u2019ll also add some quick sauteed garlic shrimp or chicken if I want to bulk it up. It\u2019s such a great go to salad/meal when you\u2019re limited on time. I love it because the brussels sprouts are so hearty that even after it\u2019s tossed together with the vinaigrette, it takes DAYS for the veg to become soggy and I actually like it when the brussels sprouts have been sitting in the vinaigrette for a day or so, the flavors really have a chance to develop. The pretzel croutons also don\u2019t get too soggy like you might expect them to; they definitely soften as time goes on but I kind of like that. If you\u2019re not into \u201csoft\u201d pretzel bits in your salad, you can always make extra pretzel croutons and refresh your salad with nice, crisp croutons every time you take this salad to the face! Brussels sprouts and bacon are such a perfect combination of flavors that a prosciutto vinaigrette just makes sense. The whole grain mustard adds a simple, but great tangy flavor and cuts through the richness of the butter and prosciutto, balancing the dish out nicely. This Thanksgiving we thought it would be nice to include brussels sprouts because it just screams chilly seasonal eats; but we thought we\u2019d skip out on the typical roasting and make a deliciously, hearty salad that is good enough to stand up next to all the other thanksgiving side dish contenders. Enjoy! xx, Jenny Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad with a Warm Prosciutto-Mustard Vinaigrette Serves 10-12

VWhile the work piles up, and time off is non-existent, staying sane for me happens with the little things. Here are some of my little things: 1. Do something that makes you feel pretty. Pluck those eyebrows or braid your hair, or wear some neat jewelry. 2. If you have a spare moment, Google pictures of somewhere you want to go. My latest go to Google image search is camping in a tee pee. 3. Look at A Cozy Kitchen\u2019s Cute Animal pinterest board:  http://pinterest.com/acozykitchen/cute-animals/ 4. Draw doodles. My favorite doodle is looking at someone, drawing his or her face without looking at the paper or lifting up the pen. 5. Think about how much cooler life is going to be once Downton Abbey returns. 6. Take baths. They are awesome and relaxing and I don\u2019t think most people do it enough. Ok you guys. We have some crazy delicious Banana Bread for you today. Do you see its one recipe three ways?

VHi Guys! If you haven\u2019t notice, Teri and I are stoked about the fall season. Not only do we get to put on our cozy clothes (if LA will just hurry up and make up its freakin\u2019 mind about the weather!!), but we get make cozy dishes and eat cozy foods! Today we have beer cheese soup. I grew up a mere hop-skip away from Wisconsin (hello Mars Cheese Castle) and have had my fair share of real beer cheese soup. If you\u2019ve never heard of it, imagine extremely flavorful cheese sauce that\u2019s infused with beer and slightly thinned for a pleasant mouthfeel\u2026.that\u2019s basically beer cheese soup. Awesome, right?! We\u2019ve infused ours with pumpkin and thyme (I love the combo and may have featured it before\u2026 here! ) for a more seasonal type of soup, but if you think straying from the original is an abomination (which is totally okay, because I even went back and forth a number of times, trying to decide if I should stick to classic or go seasonal) you can totally nix the pumpkin puree, thyme and nutmeg for an equally delicious soup. You can also switch the pumpkin ale out for a simple pilsner, which is what I usually use. What I like about the addition of pumpkin here is that unlike most things infused with pumpkin, the flavor in this dish is extremely subtle. It adds a bit of sweet, richness to the soup, but that\u2019s it\u2026it\u2019s really not too \u201cpumpkiny\u201d at all. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love me some pumpkin, but for this soup I love that it doesn\u2019t fight the beer or the cheese or the overall soup for that matter. I also blend this soup, which is not super typical. I blend the soup because I like it with no little bits inside and I feel it makes the soup super silky\u2026if you like the veggie bits, no problem\u2026just whisk the beer/broth mixture into the cheese mixture, being careful not to break your cheese sauce. This soup is easy to make and keeps well for up to 5 days! Oh and one random thing before I go\u2026.this has absolutely nothing to do with today\u2019s recipe, but has anyone seen the quinoa burger/Bud Light commercial? If not, please go watch it  now ! It might be the greatest commercial out there! I\u2019ve probably watched it over a hundred times this last month and I love it\u2026.so hilarious!! Maybe after you guys watch it you\u2019ll be inspired to make our quinoa burger\u2026which does NOT taste like a dirty old tree branch thankyouverymuch!! Enjoy and have a great weekend!! xx, Jenny Pumpkin Beer Cheese Soup Serves 3 to 4

VFigs are one of my favorite foods ever. I think I like them so much because  fig season  is incredibly short and they\u2019re nearly impossible to find fresh out of season. So when they are in season I go a little crazy and eat them almost everyday! One of my favorite things to do with figs (besides just standing in front of the fridge, stuffing my face with them) is the recipe above. It\u2019s super easy and so freakin\u2019 good! Some people aren\u2019t fans of bleu cheese\u2026.that\u2019s okay, I forgive you\u2026if that\u2019s the case I recommend switching it out for a  White Stilton  (specifically the lemon peel flavored one\u2026so good!). Another thing you might be thinking is, \u201cNOOOO! Jenny, how dare you chop up precious Marconas!\u201d I know, I know, shame on me. I like chopping them in this instance because I like the little bits of crunch you get here and there while eating these lovely little bundles of sweet, sweet love\u2026.See? I totally get a little insane when it comes to figs. Still not buying my chopping up the Marcona almonds?No problem! After the figs come out of the oven, instead of chopping them, just keep them whole and stuff them right into the figs, just like the cheese :) Enjoy! xx Jenny Bleu Cheese Stuffed Figs Makes 16

V I purchased a Roomba recently with high hopes that  I too could have a cat shark riding a Roomba around in my kitchen . Also, with two cats, it gets gross and having a robot in my house to suck up cat hair is pretty cool. The things that are not so cool is that I have somehow managed to program the Roomba to start a cleaning cycle at 3 in the morning on Sundays. At first I thought my cat magically stepped on the cleaning button, but he did not. I\u2019ve tried to figure it out how to un program it, watched the dvd that comes with it and I just can\u2019t. So basically my fix is to box the Roomba in at it\u2019s charging station on Sunday night and then it can\u2019t move. HA. Teri: 1 Roomba: 0. I\u2019ve been trying to think of a way to tie in my random Roomba story and there isn\u2019t a way. So let\u2019s just talk about these Butternut Squash Cranberry & Goat Cheese Crostini. This is basically fall bruschetta which I freaking love, because I loooovvveeeeee butternut squash so much. These simple little crostini are so pretty and colorful and look like leaves when they change for fall (I felt so pinterest inspirational quote-y when I typed that for some reason). You can add hazelnuts if you want a crunch factor too. \u2665 Teri Butternut Squash, Cranberry and Goat Cheese Crostini Serves 8 to 10

VHi! (you can\u2019t tell, but I\u2019m furiously waving at you all with a really huge, borderline creepy smile on my face!)  It\u2019s Friday\u2026yay! I could say something totally cheesy and awkward like, \u201cTGIF!!\u201d and go on and on\u2026which is normally my preferred style, but today I\u2019ll spare you all and just try to encourage you to make this drink this weekend. I love champagne, sparkling wine, prosecco, all that stuff\u2026mainly because I love the bubbles and how they tickle your nose for a second right before you take your first or second sip. I\u2019m totally one of those people who can drink \u2018bubbly\u2019, so to speak, at anytime and think it\u2019s totally unnecessary to wait to open a bottle for a \u201cspecial\u201d occassion. I love opening up a bottle and sipping on a small glass as I prepare dinner for a group of friends or even as I\u2019m making a quick little dinner for two\u2026but that\u2019s just me. This is a perfect and SUPER easy drink to make\u2026.like right now :) It takes no time at all, especially if you make the blood orange juice  mixture a day or two ahead of time and store it in the fridge. I know, I know, too much champagne tends to give most people massive headaches the next day, but that\u2019s why you should invite a bunch of friends over this weekend for a potluck and serve these as something for people to just sip on! Just sayin. The cinnamon and star anise flavors infused into the juice also make this a great holiday drink, me thinks. Enjoy! xx Jenny Spiced Blood Orange Champagne Punch Serves 3 to 5

VDid anyone else in LA feel that earthquake early this morning? I thought it was my cats fighting on the bed at first. I have not felt an earthquake here in years, and I\u2019m surprised it woke me up. When I woke up this morning I went and read the news to see if I could find any information on the quake. It was pretty close to where I live. The thing about the article that freaked me out the most was this weird foreshadowing paragraph at the end that stated that in the past 10 days, there have been earthquakes around Los Angeles. Ok, what is that supposed to mean? A huge one is coming? Are you trying to freak everyone out? I\u2019m freaked out. I think it may be time to get some earthquake insurance for all the props in the studio. Speaking of props and the studio, Jenny and I are in the new issue of  Anthology  serving up some delicious Asian inspired finger foods, AND the party takes place in our studio so you can see where we spend most of our lives. So go check out the new issue! We are continuing our Banana Bread recipe 3 ways today with Banana Bread French Toast. This recipe is pretty epic. Banana bread dipped in an egg mixture and dredged in corn flakes then topped with more bananas. It\u2019s a really good way to use up extra banana bread. Yummmm.
